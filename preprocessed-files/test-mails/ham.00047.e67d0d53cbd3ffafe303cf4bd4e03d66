( eg legal advic `` thi is / is not legal advic '' type of thing . but again , thi mean disclaim need to context-specif . ( see number . ) number . there is preced that blanket disclaim , under uk law , have no stand and that rather ( common sens thi ) it is the context of the situat that determin the legal effect of an email . see the norwich union case . anyway , my top tip to help superior who 've fallen for disclaim to see sens : number . server side append break email standard . ( unless alway done correctli - nearli imposs , caus then server ha to understand everi possibl type of client encod ) . numbera . it /does/ break certain type of encrypt , that depend on the bodi be untouch . ( eg x.number ? kate brought thi up age ago ) . numberb . iirc , it contraven mime to pre/append non mime-typ text . most mailer will work around thi and display the mail 'correctli ' , some might not though . eg the messag might not be display , or the disclaim might not be display . numberc . the correct place for disclaim is on the client side . thi also allow the user to select appropri disclaim for appropri context ( or no disclaim at all ) . number . blanket append disclaim are of dubiou legal effect . ( dilut , nu case in uk ) number . gener disclaim text is of dubiou legal effect . inde it will often be complet inappropri ( 'thi messag is confidenti ' on list mail ) . see numberc . also , it need to be written by an actual lawyer . number . a lot of big multin corpor do /not/ append disclaim . ( one i know of : compaq ( deceas ) , motorol ( iirc ) , microsoft ( iirc ) ) . use link : httpaddr ( and see link at bottom of thi page ) . final , if you cant get reason to prevail and you have to agre to implement server side disclaim , you can still resort to : '' that 'll be done just as soon as the compani stationari ha disclaim print on them . oh , and i guess we 'll have to play a disclaim befor or after all our telephon call too ? wait , that would caus a problem for fax wouldnt it ?
