well , as mani have said , it 's non-trivi and not smart enough . i did tri just cvs'ing over the exist sourc , but cv complain that my file were in the way . then i thought that i 'd onli need the dri stuff , that took about number.numb hour to fetch numberm . unfortun i still need the xfreenumb cv stuff as well : - ( at numberm that took almost number hour . now i can start build the xfreenumb cv and dri cv stuff for test the numberd patch for my gvxnumber card . i just hope i do n't complet trash my system in the process . think i 'll wait until morn to start build , though . i 've been build a new box from sourc thi week . a numbermhz pentiummmx with numberm . it took a full day to build xfreenumb number.number.numb and number.numb day each to build qtlib and kdelib . kdebas took just under number hour . i 've got lot of grief from the wife for the comput run 'round the clock thi week . the rest of kde should build in under number hour increment . cheer , john gay -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
