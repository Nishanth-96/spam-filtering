hi all , i 've run into a fairli intract ( for me ) problem , and wa wonder if anybodi could give me pointer on how to deal with it . i am run debian woodi on a pentium iii ide base system . i have a ricoh numbera ide cd rewrit , which i use use cdrecord and the scsi over ide kernel modul . i wa run kernel number.number.numb until probabl last weekend when i notic number.number.numb wa out . download patch and instal new kernel with no real problem . thi morn i went to burn a cdrom , and the system lock hard . reboot into number.number.numb allow cdburn to work fine . thi problem is veri reproduc ( on my system at least ) . the cdrecord command i wa use wa cdrecord -v speed=numb blank=fast dev=numb , number , number -data bak.iso the blank appear to go ok , but when it tri to write data , it just lock up the entir system ( ca n't ping it from outsid even ) . afaic , the system just stop . hard reset is onli way back in , and when it doe reboot , i can not see anyth use in ani logfil ( /var/log/messag /var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog , at ani rate ) . cdrecord -scanbu work fine and report the two pseudo-scsi devic ( my cdr drive and my cdrw ) . the same lock occur even if there is no blank . i tri upgrad to number.number.number-prenumber-acnumb ( on assumpt that if there wa a kernel issu it might have been fix in these patch ) , but it give the same error . i also download and compil the sourc for cdrecord number.number.numb , and instal it instead of the debian packag ( i wa wonder if mayb there wa some compil option the packag had use which mayb would caus the problem ) , and still the problem persist . anyway , i 'm complet stump . googl search ha not done me much good , and i 'm a littl bit lost . what i 'd like to know is a ) how to fix the problem ; - ) b ) is thi like to be an applic or kernel problem ? the sever of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem , but i'm not veri knowledg on these thing . c ) should i post a descript of thi to the kernel mail list ? if thi is an appropri cours of action , are there ani tip ( beyond the guidelin on kernel.org ) ? like i said , i 'm lost on thi one , so ani info is veri grate receiv . mick -- michael conri ph . : +number-number-numb , web : httpaddr key fingerprint = number bnumber number numbercnumb anumb cbnumber numberb number numberd numberc -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
