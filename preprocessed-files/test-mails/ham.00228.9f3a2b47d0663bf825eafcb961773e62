( check /etc/syslog.conf ) usual it 's someth like /var/log/cron.log or /var/log/cron anyway have a look in the log , make sure your backup ran ( so long as there were n't ani error ) . typic if there 's ani output from the command you 've run , they 're mail to you . -- philip reynold rfc network tel : number number www.rfc-networks.i fax : number number -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
