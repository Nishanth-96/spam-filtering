oh yeh one more thing . none of thi would explain whi the signatur for sample-spam.txt from spamassassin is regist on honor but not apt or fire . -- -- -origin messag -- -- - from : rose , bobbi sent : thursday , august number , number number : number am to : emailaddr emailaddr subject : re : [ razor-us ] what 's wrong with the razor server now ? thank that help . there 's still so littl info on te and those of us here sinc razorvnumb know how it work . i did set my min_cf to `` ac-numb '' which i thought would be zero . so the way you are suggest that it work now is that everyon ha a trust level of number and have to work their way up . your trust level increas when someon nomin the same messag as spam . thi must have been the new chang made at the begin of the week unless the chang dump everyon 's trust level . now here come the question ... what engin signatur doe te look at ? doe it have to be the same enumb signatur or doe it use the enumb or enumb signatur . how mani peopl have to nomin the messag befor everyon rate increas ? how mani revok decreas someon rate ? doe a singl revok decreas the rate of everyon that nomin the messag ? if a newbi report a messag that ha alreadi been report doe their trust level immedi go up ? in the case of revok , doe someon with a trust level of number have the capabl to revok a messag submit by multipl peopl with higher trust level ?

bobbi , coupl of thing : if you are not a trust report , your report will not have an immedi effect . it take a bunch of trust report to bump up the confid of a signatur to a point where it is consid to be spam . thi might be frustrat initi , but as the number of trust user grow the time delay between nomin and determin will becom shorter . of cours , it 's a lot more frustat for peopl to have their legit mail filter out due to incorrect report . also , for the purpos of test , i 'd suggest make your min_cf ( in razor-agents.conf ) to number . min_cf default to the server recommend averag confid , which at the moment is number . set min_cf to number should return true for whatev you submit ( as long as it wa not revok by a trust user ) . apt/fir sync with honor everi number minut , so you 'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of number minut befor signatur propag . cheer , vipul . on wed , aug number , number at number : number : numberpm -number , rose , bobbi wrote : > thi is still happen . noth that i report is be regist at > all . i have confirm that thi also affect the cloudmark outlook > plugin . if i block a messag from outlook use spamnet then run it > against the folder contain the messag that wa report then > noth happen . > > on the unix side , i 've tri differ cloudmark server , differ > identi , report from differ system , etc without an effect . i did > find that sample-spam.txt from spamassassin is onli regist on > honor.cloudmark.net and come back posit from it and it onli so > it 's clearli not sync 'd with apt or fire . > > > > -- -- -origin messag -- -- - > from : rose , bobbi > sent : wednesday , august number , number number : number pm > to : patrick > cc : ml-razor-us > subject : re : [ razor-us ] what 's wrong with the razor server now ?
