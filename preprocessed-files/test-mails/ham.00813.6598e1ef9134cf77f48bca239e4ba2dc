'' for most of the numberth centuri , cosmolog seem less a scienc than a religi war over , say , whether the univers had a begin , in a fieri big bang billion of year ago , or whether it exist etern in the so-cal steadi state . in the last few year , howev , a funni thing ha happen . cosmologist are begin to agre with one anoth . bless with new instrument like the hubbl space telescop and other space-bas observatori , a new gener of their giant cousin on the ground and ever-fast comput network , cosmolog is enter `` a golden age '' in which data are final outrun specul . `` the rate at which we are learn and discov new thing is just extraordinari , '' said dr. charl bennett , an astronom at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt , md . as a result , cosmologist are begin to converg on what they call a `` standard model '' of the univers that is tower in it ambit . it purport to trace , at least in broad stroke , cosmic histori from the millisecond after time began , when the univers wa a boil stew of energi and subatom particl , through the format of atom , star , galaxi and planet to the vast , dilut , dark futur in which all of these will have die . the univers , the cosmologist say , wa born number billion year ago in the big bang . most of it materi remain resid in huge cloud of invis so-cal dark matter , perhap elementari particl left over from the primordi explos and not yet identifi . within these invis cloud , the glitteri light in the sky that have defin creation for gener of human are swamp , like fleck of foam on a roll sea . a good case can be made , scientist now agre , that the univers will go on expand forev . in fact , recent observ have suggest that the expans of the univers is speed up over cosmic time , under the influenc of a `` dark energi '' even more mysteri than dark matter . recent , a group of astronom led by dr. william perciv at the univers of edinburgh combin data from a varieti of observ to compil , base on the simplest theoret model , what they say is the most precis enumer yet of the paramet that cosmologist have been fight about for all these decad . the univers , they calcul , is number.numb billion year old , plu or minu half a billion year . onli number.numb percent of it is made of ordinari matter . matter of all type , known and unknown , lumin and dark , account for just number.numb percent . the rest of creation , number.numb percent , is the mysteri dark energi , they report in a paper submit last month to the monthli notic of the royal astronom societi . it is a pictur that in some way is surprisingli simpl , satisfi long-held theoret prejudic about how the univers should be design . continu agreement with come experi may mean that scienc is approach the end of a `` great program '' of cosmolog test that began in the number 's , dr. p. j. e. peebl of princeton and dr. bharat ratra of kansa state univers said in the draft of a come articl for the review of modern physic . in other way thi new dark univers is utterli baffl , a road map to new mysteri . dr. marc davi , a cosmologist at the univers of california at berkeley , call it `` a univers chock full of exot that do n't make sens to anybodi . '' moreov there are some question that scientist still do not know how to ask , let alon answer , scientif . wa there anyth befor the big bang ? is there a role for life in the cosmo ? whi is there someth rather than noth at all ? will we ever know ? `` we know much , but we still understand veri littl , '' said dr. michael turner , a cosmologist at the univers of chicago . the big question expand forev , or big crunch ? the dim cave of lascaux , the plain of stoneheng and the dreamtim tale of australian aborigin all testifi to the need to explain the world and exist . thi quest took it present form in number . that wa when albert einstein took hi new gener theori of rel , which explain how matter and energi warp space-tim to produc graviti , and appli it to the univers . einstein discov that the cosmo as hi theori describ it would be unstabl , prone to collaps under it own graviti . astronom , howev , were sure that the univers wa stabl . so einstein ad a fudg factor that he call the cosmolog constant to hi equat . it act as a long-rang repuls forc to counterbal graviti . in number , the astronom edwin hubbl discov that the univers wa expand . the sky wa full of distant galaxi all rush away from us and one anoth , as if propel by what the british astronom dr. fred hoyl later call deris a `` big bang . '' the univers wa not stabl and , thu , did not requir counterbalanc . einstein abandon hi constant , refer to it as hi biggest blunder . but it would return to haunt cosmologist , and the univers . hoyl 's term stuck , and the notion of an explos genesi becam orthodoxi in number , when dr. arno penzia and dr. robert wilson , radio astronom at bell laboratori , discov a faint uniform radio glow that pervad the sky . it wa , cosmologist conclud , the fade remnant of the primordi firebal itself . reliev of their fudg factor , the equat describ einstein 's univers were simpl . dr. allan sandag , the carnegi observatori astronom , onc call cosmolog '' the search for two number '' - one , the hubbl constant , tell how fast the univers is expand , and the other tell how fast the expans is slow , and thu whether the univers will expand forev or not . the second number , known as the deceler paramet , indic how much the cosmo had been warp by the densiti of it content . in a high-dens univers , space would be curv around on itself like a ball . such a univers would eventu stop expand and fall back togeth in a big crunch that would extinguish space and time , as well as the galaxi and star that inhabit them . a low-dens univers , on the other hand , would have an opposit or `` open '' curvatur like a saddl , harder to envis , and would expand forev . in between with no overal warpag at all wa a '' goldilock '' univers with just the right densiti to expand forev but more and more slowli , so that after an infinit time it would coast to a stop . thi wa a `` flat '' univers in the cosmolog parlanc , and to mani theorist the simplest and most mathemat beauti solut of all . but the sky did not yield those cosmic number easili , even with the help of the number-inch hale telescop on palomar mountain in southern california , dedic in number , which had been built larg for that task . dr. hubbl wrote of measur shadow and search `` among ghostli error of measur for landmark that are scarc more substanti . '' the dark side invis matter mold galaxi it wa not till the mid-numb 's , a quarter-centuri after the palomar giant began oper , that group of astronom reach the tent conclus that the univers they could see - star , ga , planet and galaxi - did not have nearli enough gravit oomph to stop the cosmic expans . `` so the univers will continu to expand forev and galaxi will get farther and farther apart , and thing will just die , '' dr. sandag said at the time . but the great argument wa just begin . appar there wa a lot of the univers that astronom could not see . the star and galaxi , were move as if immers in the graviti of giant invis cloud of so-cal dark matter - `` miss matter '' the swiss astronom dr. fritz zwicki label it in the number 's . mani galaxi , for exampl , are rotat so fast that they would fli apart unless they were be rein in by the graviti of halo of dark matter , accord to pioneer observ by dr. vera rubin of the carnegi institut of washington and her colleagu . her measur indic that these dark halo outweigh the visibl galaxi themselv from number to number time . but there could be even more dark matter farther out in space , perhap enough to stop the expans of the univers , eventu , some theorist suggest . lumin matter , the darth vader of the sky said , is like the snow on mountaintop . but what is the dark matter ? while some of it is ga or dark dim object like star and planet , cosmologist specul that most of it is subatom particl left over from the big bang . mani varieti of these particl are predict by theori of high-energi physic . but their exist ha not been confirm or detect in particl acceler . `` we theorist can invent all sort of garbag to fill the univers , '' dr. sheldon glashow , a harvard physicist and nobel laureat , told a gather on dark matter in number . collect known as wimp 's , for weakli interact massiv particl , such particl would not respond to electromagnet , the forc respons for light , and thu would be unabl to radiat or reflect light . they would also be rel slow-mov , or `` cold '' in physic jargon , and thu also go by the name of cold dark matter . as earth in it travel pass through the dark-matt cloud that presum envelop the milki way , the particl would shoot through our bodi , rare leav a trace , like moonlight through a window . but the collect graviti of such particl , cosmologist say , would shape the cosmo and it content . gather along the fault line laid down by random perturb of densiti in the earli univers , dark matter would congeal into cloud with about the mass of number , number sun . the ordinari matter that wa mix in with it would cool and fall to the center of the cloud and light up as star . the cloud would then attract other cloud . through a seri of merger over billion of year , smaller cloud would assembl into galaxi , and the galaxi would then assembl themselv into cluster of thousand of galaxi , and so forth . use the hubbl and other telescop as time machin - light travel at a finit speed , so the farther out astronom look the farther back in time they see - cosmologist have begun to confirm that the univers did assembl itself from the `` bottom up , '' as the dark matter model predict . last year , two team of astronom report see the first star burn their way out of the cloudi aftermath of the big bang , when the univers wa onli number million year old . the bulk of galaxi format occur when the univers wa a half to a quarter it present age , cosmologist say . `` the big news in the last decad is that even half a univers ago the univers look pretti differ , '' said dr. alan dressler of the carnegi observatori in pasadena . galaxi befor then were small and irregular , with no sign of the majest spiral spider web that decor the sky today . we would bare recogn our own milki way galaxi , if we could see it five billion year ago when the sun form , he said . `` by eight billion year back , it would be unrecogniz , '' said dr. dressler . yet there are still mani question that the cold dark matter model doe not answer . astronom still do not know , for exampl , how the first star form or whi the model of dark matter distribut do n't quit fit in the core of some kind of galaxi . nor have the dark matter particl themselv been unambigu detect or identifi , despit continu experi . some astronom suggest that the discrep stem from the inabl of simpl mathemat model to deal with messi detail of the real world . `` it 's a huge mysteri exactli how star form , '' dr. richard bond of the canadian institut for theoret astrophys said . `` we ca n't solv it now . so it 's even harder to tri to solv them back then . '' but other , notabl dr. mordehai milgrom , a theorist at the weizmann institut in israel , have suggest that modifi the gravit law by which dark matter wa deduc in the first place would allevi the need for dark matter altogeth . the bang 's fuel inflat one ounc to a whole univers clue to what had actual explod in the big bang emerg as an unexpect gift from anoth great scientif quest : physicist ' pursuit for a so-cal theori of everyth that would unit all physic phenomena in a singl equat . unabl to build machin power enough to test their most ambiti notion on earth , some theorist turn to the sky . `` the big bang is the poor man 's particl acceler , '' dr. jakob zeldovich , an influenti russian cosmologist , said . physicist recogn four forc at work in the world today - graviti , electromagnet , and the strong and weak nuclear forc . but they suspect , base on data from particl acceler and high-pow theori , that those are simpli differ manifest of a singl unifi forc that rule the univers in it earliest , hottest moment . as the univers cool , accord to thi theori , there wa a fall from grace , and the law of physic evolv , with one forc after anoth `` freez out , '' or split away . in number , dr. alan guth , now at the massachusett institut of technolog , realiz that a hypothes glitch in thi process would have had drastic consequ for the univers . under some circumst , a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperatur fall below number degre , until it is disturb , at which point it will rapidli freez , releas latent heat in the process . similarli , the univers could `` supercool '' and stay in a unifi state too long . in that case , space itself would becom temporarili imbu with a mysteri kind of latent heat , or energi . insert into einstein 's equat , the latent energi would act as a kind of antigrav , and the univers would blow itself apart , dr. guth discov in a calcul in number . in far less than the blink of an eye , number-numb second , a speck much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size of a grapefruit and then resum it more state expans , with all of normal cosmic histori befor it , result in today 's observ univers - a patch of sky and star number billion light-year across . all , by the magical-seem logic of einstein 's equat , from about an ounc of primordi stuff . `` the univers , '' dr. guth like to say , `` might be the ultim free lunch . '' dr. guth call hi theori inflat . inflat , as dr. guth point out , explain whi the univers is expand . dr. turner of the univers of chicago refer to it as '' the dynamit behind the big bang . '' as modifi and improv by dr. andrei lind , now at stanford , and by dr. paul steinhardt , now at princeton and dr. andrea albrecht now at the univers of california at davi , inflat ha been the workhors of cosmolog ever sinc . one of it great virtu , cosmologist say , is that inflat explain the origin of galaxi , the main citizen of the cosmo . the answer come from the paradoxical-sound quantum rule that govern subatom affair . on the smallest scale , accord to quantum theori , natur is lumpi , emit even energi in littl bit and subject to an irreduc random . as a result , so-cal quantum fluctuat would leav faint lump in the earli univers . these would serv as the gravit seed for futur galaxi and other cosmic structur . as a result of such success , cosmologist have stuck with the idea of inflat , even though , lack the abil to test their theori at the high energi of the big bang , they have no precis theori about what might have actual caus it . `` inflat is actual a class of theori , '' said dr. guth . in the latest version , call `` chaotic inflat , '' dr. lind ha argu that quantum fluctuat in a myriad of theoriz forc field could have done the trick . inde , he and other now say they believ that inflat can occur over and over , spawn an endless chain of univers out of one anoth , like bubbl within bubbl . `` the univers inflat on top of itself , '' dr. lind told a physic confer thi spring in princeton . `` it' happen right now . '' the golden age new devic detect primordi glow if the inflationari theorist are right , the univers we see , the number billion light-year , is just a tini piec of a much vaster univers , or even a whole ensembl of them , forev out of our view . accord to the theori , therefor , our own littl patch of the cosmo should appear geometr `` flat , '' the way a section of a balloon look flat when view close up . thi wa the univers long thought to be the most beauti and simpl . but it requir , by the logic of einstein 's gener rel , that there be much more dark matter , or someth , to the univers , enough to `` flatten '' space-tim , than astronom had found . in fact , thi prescript wa so hard to reconcil with other observ , of galaxi and their evolut , that by number some astronom and press report suggest that the entir theoret edific of inflat to blow up the univers and cold dark matter to fill it , not to say the big bang itself , might have to be junk . so it wa with a sigh of relief that cosmologist greet the announc in april number that nasa 's cosmic background explor , or cobe , satellit had succeed in discern faint blotch in the primordi cosmic radio glow . these were the seed from which , inflat predict , larg cosmic structur would eventu grow . `` if you 're religi , it 's like see god , '' said dr. georg smoot , a physicist from the lawrenc berkeley nation laboratori who led the cobe team . astronom say cobe signal a transit in which heroic idea about the univers began to be replac by heroic data , as long-plan new telescop and other instrument went into oper . a year later , skywalk astronaut correct the hubbl telescop 's myopic vision . the cosmic background radiat ha come in for particular scrutini from new radio telescop mount in balloon and on mountaintop . the news ha been good , though not decis , for inflat . for three year , a seri of increasingli high-resolut observ ha confirm that the pattern of blotch stippl the remnant of the primordi firebal is consist with the predict from inflat and cold dark matter . the instrument have now map detail small enough to have been the seed of modern cluster of galaxi . `` i 'm complet snow by the cosmic background radiat , '' dr. guth said . `` the signal wa so weak it wa n't even detect until number , and now they 're measur fluctuat of one part in number , number . '' perhap most import , the analysi of the fluctuat indic that the univers ha a `` flat '' geometri , as predict by inflat . that wa a triumph . although observ could not prove that inflat wa right , a nonflat univers would have been a blow to the theori , and to cosmolog orthodoxi . `` inflat , our boldest and most promis theori of the earliest moment of creation , pass it first veri import test , '' dr. turner said at the time . the most precis measur of the cosmic background , at least in the near futur , are gener expect to come late thi year from nasa 's microwav anisotropi project , or map , satellit , which wa launch into space last year on june number . map will be follow by the european space agenc 's planck satellit , in number . it is highli unlik that map or planck will be abl to detect what dr. turner call `` the smoke gun signatur of inflat . '' the violent stretch of the univers should roil space-tim with so-cal gravit wave that would leav a faint imprint on the cosmic firebal . detect those wave would not onli confirm inflat , but also might help scientist establish what caus the inflat in the first place , give scienc it first look at the strang physic that prevail when creation wa onli about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old . the univers 's fate bleak implic of `dark energi ' in number , two compet team of astronom startl the scientif world with the news that the expans of the univers seem to be speed up under the influenc of a mysteri antigrav that seem embed in space itself and that is hauntingli reminisc of einstein 's old , presum discredit , cosmolog constant . `` dark energi , '' the phenomenon wa quickli name . if dark energi is real and the acceler continu , the galaxi will eventu speed away from one anoth so quickli that they could n't see one anoth . the univers would becom cold and empti as the continu acceler suck away the energi need for life and thought . it would be `` the worst possibl univers , '' for the qualiti and quantiti of life , said dr. lawrenc krauss , a physicist at case western reserv univers . dr. edward witten of the institut for advanc studi in princeton , call the discoveri of dark energi `` the strangest experiment find sinc i 've been in physic . '' the discoveri wa a surpris to the astronom involv . neither team had expect to find the univers acceler . they had each set out to measur by how much the expans of the univers wa slow becaus of the graviti of it content and thu settl the question of it fate . one team wa led by dr. saul perlmutt , a physicist at lawrenc berkeley . the other team wa a band of astronom led by dr. brian schmidt of mount stromlo and the side spring observatori in australia . each group employ far-flung network of telescop , includ the hubbl , and the internet to find and monitor certain explod star , or supernova , as cosmic beacon . such explos , the death rattl of massiv star , are power enough to be seen clear across the univers when the univers wa younger and , presum , expand faster . leapfrog each other across the univers , the two team , propiti for their credibl , arriv at the same answer at the same time : the cosmo wa not slow at all ; it wa speed up . dr. perlmutt , who had onc resent the competit , conced , `` with onli one group , it would have been a lot harder to get the commun to buy into such a surpris result . '' `` thi wa a veri strang result , '' said dr. adam riess , a member of dr. schmidt 's team . `` it wa the opposit of what we thought we were do . '' the result have sent einstein 's old cosmolog constant to the forefront of cosmolog . despit hi disavow , the constant had never realli gone away and had in fact been given new life by quantum physic . einstein had famous reject quantum 's random , say god did n't play dice . but it justifi , in retrospect , hi fudg factor . accord to the uncertainti principl , a pillar of quantum theori , empti space wa not empti , but rather foam with the energi of so-cal virtual particl as they flash in and out of exist on borrow energi . thi so-cal vacuum energi could repel , just like einstein 's old cosmolog constant , or attract . the case for dark energi got even stronger a year later , when the cosmic background observ report evid of a flat univers . becaus astronom had been abl to find onli about a third as much matter , both dark and lumin , as wa need by einstein 's law to creat a flat geometri , someth els had to be ad to it . the discoveri of dark energi exemplifi dr. zeldovich' view of the univers as the poor man 's particl acceler , and it caught the physicist flat-foot , somewhat to the pride of the astronom . `` a come of age of astronomi , '' dr. dressler call it . what is dark energi ? the question now hang over the univers . is it realli einstein 's old fudg factor return to haunt hi children ? in that case , as the univers expand and the volum of space increas , astronom say , the push becaus of dark energi will also increas , acceler the galaxi away from one anoth faster and faster , lead to a dire dark futur . other physicist , howev , have point out that the theori of modern physic are replet with mysteri forc field , collect call `` quintess , '' that might or might not exist , but that could temporarili produc neg graviti and mimic the action of a cosmolog constant . in that case , all bet on the futur are off . the univers could acceler and then deceler , or vice versa as the dark energi field rose or fell . a third possibl is that dark energi doe not exist at all , in which case not just the futur , but the whole care construct jigsaw puzzl of cosmolog , might be in doubt . the effect of cosmic acceler could be mimick , astronom say , by unusu dust in the far univers or by unsuspect chang in the characterist of supernova over cosmic time . as a result , more group are join the origin two team in the hunt for new supernova and other way to measur the effect of dark energi on the histori of the univers . dr. perlmutt ha propos build a special satellit telescop , the supernova astronomi project , to investig exactli when and how abruptli the cosmic acceler kick in . the nag questionsa grand synthesi , but hardli complet for all the new answer be harvest , some old question linger , and they have now been join by new one . a flat univers is the most mathemat appeal solut of einstein 's equat , cosmologist agre . but they are puzzl by the specif recip , larg help of dark matter and dark energi , that natur ha chosen . dr. turner call it `` a preposter univers . '' but dr. martin ree , a cambridg univers cosmologist , said that the discoveri of a deeper principl govern the univers and , perhap , life , may alter our view of what is fundament . some featur of the univers that are now consid fundament - like the exact mixtur of dark matter , dark energi and regular stuff in the cosmo - may turn out to be mere accid of evolut in one out of the mani , mani univers allow by etern inflat . `` if we had a theori , then we would know whether there were mani big bang or one , '' dr. ree said . the answer to these and other question , mani scientist suspect , have to await the final unif of physic , a theori that reconcil einstein 's rel , which describ the shape of the univers , to the quantum chao that live insid it . such a theori , quantum graviti , is need to describ the first few moment of the univers , when it wa so small that even space and time should becom fuzzi and discontinu . for two decad , mani physicist have place their bet for quantum graviti on string theori , which posit that elementari particl are tini string vibrat in a number- or number-dimension space . each kind of particl , in a sens , correspond to a differ note on the string . in principl , string theori can explain all the forc of natur . but even it adher conced that their equat are just approxim to an unknown theori that they call m-theori , with `` m '' stand for matrix , magic , mysteri or even mother , as in `` mother of all theori . '' moreov , the effect of `` stringi physic '' are onli evid at energi forev beyond the limit of particl acceler . some string theorist have ventur into cosmolog , hope , to discov some effect that would show up in the poor man 's particl acceler , the sky . in addit to string , the theori also includ membran , or `` brane , '' of variou dimens . our univers can be envis as such a brane float in higher-dimension space like a leaf in a fish tank , perhap with other brane univers nearbi . these brane could interact gravit or even collid , set off the big bang . in one version suggest last year by four cosmologist led by dr. steinhardt of princeton , anoth brane would repeatedli collid with our own . they pass back and forth through each other , caus our univers to undergo an etern chain of big bang . such notion are probabl the futur for those who are paid to wonder about the univers . and the fruit of thi work could yet caus cosmologist to reconsid their new consensu , warn dr. peebl of princeton , who ha often act as the conscienc of the cosmolog commun , tri to put the brake on faddish trend . he wonder whether the situat today can be compar to anoth histor era , around number , when mani peopl thought that physic wa essenti finish and when the english physicist lord kelvin said that just a coupl of '' cloud '' remain to be dealt with . `` a few annoy tidbit , which turn out to be rel and quantum theori , '' the twin revolut of numberth-centuri scienc , dr. peebl said . likewis , there are a few cloud today like what he call '' the dark sector , '' which could have more complic physic than cosmologist think . `` i 'm not convinc these cloud herald revolut as deep as rel and quantum mechan , '' dr. peebl said . `` i 'm not argu that they wo n't . '' as for the fate of the univers , we will never have a firm answer , said dr. sandag , who wa hubbl 's protg and ha seen it all . `` it 's like ask , `doe god exist ? ' `` he said . predict the futur , he point out , requir faith that simpl mathemat model realli work to describ the univers . `` i do n't think we realli know how thing work , '' he said . although dr. sandag doe not buy into all aspect of the emerg orthodoxi , he said it wa a fantast time to be aliv . `` it 's all work toward a much grander synthesi than we could have imagin number year ago , '' he said . `` i think thi is the most excit life i could have had .
