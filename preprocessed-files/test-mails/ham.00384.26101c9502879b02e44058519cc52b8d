( the up side is that the competit drive the differ organis to constantli improv their product offer [ number ] . ) so unlik suno vs aix vs hpux vs trunumb , where the api 's and avail function were often starkli differ , linux distribut are mostli the same . while i may have to look in /var/nam on red hat , and /etc/bind on debian , the binari are basic the same , as are the man page . in most case , do a `` man name '' will reveal the compil locat of the config file . so long as thi is understood , it is easi enough to administ most linux distribut . i expect that as compani and public sector organis begin to understand the open sourc paradigm , you will find even more distribut appear . the reason i believ thi is that deriv a new distribut from , say , debian requir compar littl effort . i would see thi requir slightli more effort than the amount of time mani enterpris admin spend tri to customis the desktop , screen saver and softwar distribut mechan of their own organis . imho , as alway ... - matthew [ number ] depend on your world view , thi may be rephras as `` they need to make oodl of profit and screw the littl man to surviv . '' thi discuss is beyond the scope of thi list . : ) [ number ] the often overlook problem with competit is that it weaken the '' combat '' , leav the field open for a less power forc to take over and entrench it posit ( in thi case i would be refer to microsoft ) . howev , i do not believ thi will effect the linux movement as all the vendor are oblig to work togeth to a great degre , thank to the gpl . __________________________________________________ do you yahoo ! ? everyth you 'll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music chart httpaddr -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
