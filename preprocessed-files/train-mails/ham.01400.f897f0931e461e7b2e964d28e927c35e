hi there , now thi is probabl of no use to you whatsoev , but ... not a deb-head , but i also have a problem regard nvidia . i 've two machin , pretti much the same hardwar . athlon numberxp 's , both have nvidia card , one gforcenumb ti and a gforcenumbermx , both use the same driver modul . both have same kernel version albeit it compil for their particular hardwar . one work perfectli , the other fail to load . when i check with lsmod , i can see the nvdriver is load , but not use ; -- ( thu when i startx , it bomb out . iu still have x with the default nv driver and crappi acceller -- > numberfp with glxgear [ should be over numberfp ] it not a hardwar issu with the card as i swap them over and get the same symptom . i reckon my mobo is cack , i 've tri swap slot around , reserv resourc etc all to no avail . should there be an interrupt for the nv card ? i have n't check the other box yet . regard , cw -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - on tue , number dec number , mark page wrote : > wa run debian woodi perfectli well until i instal the nvidia numberd > tar packag . you probabl stil are ; ) > both the kernel and glx packag instal with no problem and i then > amend the xfree config file appropri ( accord to all > instruct ) . neither gdm nor kdm will now fire up return me to the > consol screen . ie x is broken . > run startx i isol the problem to a failur to load the nvidia > kernel modul - by cd'ing to the kernel modul file and re-run 'make > instal ' i can get a workabl xserver so you fix x . > minu the prefer you would get from either gdm or kdm and to be > honest the gui is horribl . if x is work and you get a brief nvidia splash screen then thi is like noth to do with the driver itself . you should be abl to use kdm or gdm with the nvidia xserver . what exactli did you chang in your xfnumberconfig ? will gdm/kdm not start ? > i follow the nvidia suggest of 'make instal > sysinclude=/path/to/kernel/head ' and whilst thi appear to instal > ok upon reboot i am back to the same consol login and have to go > through the same reinstal of the kernel modul . i have tri rewrit > the xf config file to it 's origin state with no success . well , thi sound like the nvidia kernel modul is n't load on boot . when it *is* work do a quick /sbin/lsmod and look for the modul name ( someth like 'nvdriver ' ) . then put thi on a new line in /etc/modul in order that linux will load it on boot . you can just do modprob nvdriver to load it by hand . your make instal did thi as well as reinstal the driver in /lib etc . you should also get a messag say load the nvidia driver taint your kernel ( which it doe , in the sens that it 's not open sourc ) . > is thi a problem anyon els ha encount and what is the best > solut ? can i rid myself of the tar file instal and find some > specif .deb packag ? the nvidia driver sourc is in the woodi tree . httpaddr so you can do apt-get instal nvidia-kernel-src and then compil , although i 've alway gone the rout you 're do now . ideal the nvidia driver would be a part of the kernel from day number . howev , nvidia have not open sourc it ( most of the abov sourc is pre-compil object code ) , but in order for it to work with your specif kernel you must compil against your kernel header ( as you did ) . as debian ha lot of potenti kernel they ca n't have one nvdriver packag and have chosen instead to provid the sourc . actual i do n't know if they 're permit to distribut binari by nvidia 's licens anyway . gavin -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
