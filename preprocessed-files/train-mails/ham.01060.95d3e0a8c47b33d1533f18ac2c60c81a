nri number one expat help hindi film make dollar and sens even at their own expens by jeann e. fredriksen the expatri in film is noth new . casablanca star humphrey bogart as the suav , mysteri rick in morocco remain the top favorit number year after it releas in america . although expat charact ' live are tradit paint as be extraordinari , the simpl fact that they live `` elsewher '' add a sens of adventur , a dash of romanc , and a bit of wish long . howev , expat have never made the kind of impact on film that non-resid indian ( nri ) have with hindi cinema , both at the box offic and on the big screen . accord to india 's number censu , the countri 's popul exceed the number billion person mileston , and there are approxim number million indian live , work , and studi elsewher around the world . nri have becom a seriou market for the hindi film industri , particularli in the u.k. , where approxim number percent of the popul is indian/pakistani , and in the u.s. , where number.numb million out of number.numb million peopl are indian . the rupe box offic is now augment quit handsom by the dollar-and-pound box offic , much to the delight of director and produc . among the film report a half-to-three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar box offic in the u.s. or the u.k. are aa ab laut chalen ( number ) , kaho naa pyaar hai ( number ) , refuge ( number ) , lajja ( number ) , and asoka ( number ) . the nri `` million-dollar-box-offic club '' boast such film as yaadein ( number ) and lagaan ( number ) in the u.s. taal ( number ) , hum saath saath hain ( hssh , number ) , and mohabbatein ( number ) made the mark or better in the u.k. taal and hssh doubl their u.k. intak in the u.s. and brought in dollarnumb million each . kuch kuch hota hai ( number ) talli up dollarnumber.numb million in the u.k. most recent , set a new high-wat mark in the oversea box offic , kabhi khushi kabhi gham ( knumberg , number ) grab the no . number spot it first week of releas in the u.s. and earn dollarnumber.numb million dure it five-week run . in the u.k. , knumberg earn nearli dollarnumber.numb million over an number week run . impress ? ye , consid that promot of hindi film outsid of the indian commun is virtual zero , although that may be on the brink of chang slightli . if noth els , the figur indic that the nri spend a big chunk of chang on the film . dure the past decad , the inclus of nri charact in both commerci and non-commerci film ha been on the rise , and in a circular logic , it 's onli natur that they have becom a part of these film ' stori . each nri touch someon in india , and these `` global indian , '' as filmmak subhash ghai ha call them , can not be shrug off as a pass phase . film featur or `` made for '' nri have been critic by some in india , but in realiti , mani of those film have perform extrem well at the indian box offic . could thi speak to the lure of adventur and the romanc of the nri ? the first hindi blockbust to spotlight nri charact wa dilwal dulhania le jayeng ( ddlj , number ) , the stori of two young peopl who grew up indian in london . ddlj introduc us to the mischiev , prank-pul raj , who in the begin fail to graduat but succe in pilfer a case of beer from an indian-own conveni store . in the end , he steadfastli appli indian sensibl in hi pursuit of the rebellious-but-trap simran as her unwant arrang marriag approach . veri possibl , becaus of thi juxtaposit of trait , attitud , and event , ddlj enjoy the distinct of be the longest-continually-run film in indian cinema histori . popular asid , there is the ongo issu regard accuraci in the character of nri in film . often they are drawn as stereotyp , which are easi to lean on , requir neither depth nor dimens . becaus of thi , hindi filmmak may be said to straddl the border separ east and west , stay secur at home and dip into their highly-fantas world of the indian diaspora . in mani case , commerci hindi film present an overly-devis sens of the nri as be either corruptly-western or as be more homesick than a child gone away to camp for the first time . while these concept may carri a certain truth , the correspond misconcept come from the mind of the at-hom indian , who wag a seemingly-envi finger at the nri 's abil to exist in two world : one allow space and upward mobil , the other offer tradit and histori . pompou , materialist , alcohol-drink , cigarette-smok , drug-tak , affair-hav , spoil brat the first hindi film i saw wa subhash ghai 's pard ( number ) . despit encourag me to see more film , it made me wonder if `` nri '' actual meant `` not realli indian . '' if the nri charact were n't silli , whiney troublemak , they were mean and nasti , embrac everi possibl neg human qualiti in stark contrast to the pristin kusum ganga . even the dialogu and song lyric in the film were design to instruct the viewer that the west is inferior but one can still bring india back into one 's life . the film is propaganda at it finest and fill with relentless remind of good vs. evil , puriti vs. corrupt , right vs. wrong , tradit vs. modern in short india vs. the west . but thi is not where the neg end . veri often , there is a `` dress code '' for the femal charact to help the viewer understand her measur of puriti or wicked : the more traditionally-dress , the more indian the woman . unsurprisingli , thi doe not seem to carri over to the men 's charact . run alongsid thi can be the `` train guid '' in which nri are constantli reeduc that `` thi is not india , '' `` thi is not america , '' `` onli in india , '' `` thi is our cultur . '' the repetit seem less design to be a natur part of life than to foster reinforc , as if nri are too ignor to appreci it the first time . when indian achiev success and wealth , have larg home , and own their compani in these film , they are industri , clever , and respect businessmen . the nri equival is held up to a doubl standard and consid materialist . even the print synopsi of taal in the ero entertainment/bnumberu dvd booklet refer to the nri charact ' `` world of ruthless materi . '' on the other hand , the mumbai-bas , plagiar vikrant kapoor charact is likeabl enough and present as an opportunist , which seem to be a step up . itali is an unlik origin for an nri and offspr in a hindi film , but hum dil de chuke sanam ( number ) fill the bill . for all the film 's splendor , it wa regrett that the indo-italian sameer wa present as a nave , bumbl nerd who had littl go for him beyond hi sing abil . yaadein gave us a kind and love , if slightli confus , singl parent from london rais three daughter who suffer enough issu to put a therapist into a tailspin . as if that were n't enough , the film includ an american-rais brat who want noth to do with parent , settl down , or have babieshardli the ideal indian bride-to-b . and what happen when a marri nri coupl split into the `` modern '' vs. the `` old-fashion ? '' the wife is toss out like the garbag and sent home to india as punish for be unrecept to have affair outsid of marriag . such is the initi setup for lajja , rajkumar santoshi 's look into the world of indian women . show me the way to go home the other extrem of nri in film is the homesick , culture-crav , more-patriotic-than-th indian . build their own mini-india for maxi-memori , thi nri portray take a real issu and magnifi it to unreal proport . and no film illustr that as extravagantli as the lush and sumptuou kabhi khushi kabhi gham ( knumberg ) . not onli did knumberg enjoy a healthi run at home , it explod worldwid onto theater screen in indian commun last decemb and play to pack hous for week . and knumberg is a film in which everythinghom , transport , financ , fashion , holiday , event , emot , and tearsset a new standard for the term `` larger-than-lif . '' in knumberg , much of the post-interv footag take place in england . for anjali , life in london simmer with a patriot zeal and an all-consum homesick manifest in the meticul mainten of indian custom and ritual while she separ herself from her surround . her need for india is so overwhelm that she reli on the fals protect of mock peopl and place outsid of her own famili and home . overkil ? certainli , as writer-director karan johar 's inflat represent of what have becom some of the filmi passion of the typic nri . but when it boil down to the common denomin without the fanfar , flash , and fervor , even those who move across countri miss their famili and familiar surround ; one alway retain a credibl amount of home-turf loyalti ; and if one 's heritag is lost , the person is render as no more than a racial statist . `` those live in india are surround by our cultur everi minut , even if they do n't realiz it , '' say vivek malhotra , a thirty-someth nri and busi owner in the chicago area . `` here it 's differ , but we will alway be indian , '' he continu , strike at the heart of the perceiv problem . `` sometim , i feel that the movi think we 've forgotten that . mayb the filmmak should spend some time find out who we are . i realli do n't think they have a clue . '' on the upsid is a benefici aspect for the children of nri . `` it 's good that these film show our kid what happen in indiath tradit , custom , valu , '' say parag gandhi , a long time theater owner and promot of hindi film in chicago . `` they may be modern in india , but the tradit valu remain . '' and mani popular film target the late-teen , twenty-someth demograph . `` film such as dilwal dulhania le jayeng , kuch kuch hota hai , and knumberg , '' add gandhi , `` are exampl of film that are half tradit , half modern , strike a balanc between the two for all of the market . '' anoth posit consider is that not all film show nri in a question light . caricatur of nri have been challeng in commerci film like kaho naa pyaar hai , dil chhata hai ( number ) , monsoon wed ( number ) , and the recent kitn door kitn paa , all of which present nri as more realist , more human charact . aa ab laut chalen offer a varieti of nri person from the selfish , the conniv , and the parti anim to the lovabl cabbi and the pandit-cop who make the best of their situat without complaint . interestingli , the film also dare to includ shop owner , dunkin ' donut clerk , ga station attend : charact who are n't weigh down by palati surround , corpor crise , or oversea judgment . the u.s. , the u.k. , and australia are repres in bombay boy ( number ) by three young men coming/return to bombay , india for person reason . in a refresh revers of the typic attitud concern nri in film , the boy are the `` good '' indian , and everyon they meet ha some relationship with the darker side of the citi . at it most basic , the film show that if someth is lost , it wo n't necessarili be found in india . even the non-commerci , multi-award-win bawandar ( number ) incorpor an nri as a connect thread in the piec togeth of sanvri devi 's stori . curiou , passion about women 's right , the indo-english journalist repres the fact that the stori ha a wider interest than a small , rural villag . step outsid of the hindi film industri for a moment , the english/telegu film hyderabad blue ( number ) and the english/tamil film mitrmi friend ( number ) , both smaller-budget film built on deliv messag without preach , deserv mention . the former engag in the question of , rather than the critic of , east vs. west , and the latter examin the challeng face by women , nri , and their famili . the charact and stori of both film enjoy respect in their present , partial due to the exist of layer issu that are reveal and resolv ( or not ) without finger-snap swift or clichd answer . hyderabad blue enjoy a number-week run in mumbai alon , and mitrmi friend is current one of the most-rent film in indian commun in the u.s. while the inclus of nri in hindi film doe not guarante box offic success outsid of india , it doe send a strong signal that filmmak acknowledg thi constantli grow and lucr audienc sector . if the big-budget , big box-offic commerci film come out of mumbai often seem to bite one of the hand that feed it , ha the box offic anywher been advers affect ? well no , not by ani chart report that can be found . and that , itself , send a loud and clear messag back to the industri in mumbai : `` if it is n't broken , do n't fix it . '' nevertheless , when filmmak who see nri as fall onli to the evil side of western way look beyond their assumpt , perhap they will discard their relianc on stereotyp and start pay their oversea famili an increas measur of respect . and when filmmak who take the homesick and patriot theme beyond believ analyz their own feel , perhap they will realiz that what nri hold dear in their heart is no differ from what those at home should be proud of . n note : all box offic figur are report as usdollar and are courtesi of varieti magazin onlin archiv . not all hindi film abroad report box offic , and not all box offic report are avail . jeann e. fredriksen write from chicago . she is famili with , friend with , acquaint with , and work for nri with an amaz varieti of person , attitud , hope , dream , goal , livelihood , need , want , and belief . ========================================= dilwal dulhaniya le jayeng so global success is the film that in number it warrant a billboard outsid shinjuku train station in tokyo , japan , announc it screen sponsor by india center there . shinjuku is the entertain center of tokyo , and there is plenti of high-profil competit for attent , attend , and box offic . in japan , where indian film enjoy a certain popular with the nativ , the countri 's number popul censu of number.numb million person show onli number , number were indian with an addit number , number be other south asian . without question , ddlj continu to be a favorit whenev , wherev offer for view . kabhi khushi kabhi gham accord to a report in the south china morn post in januari , number , all screen of knumberg in decemb , number , were sell-out in hong kong , while pirat copi of the film were the hottest item circul on the island . hong kong 's number popul censu of number.numb million peopl reveal that number , number were indian and anoth number , number were nepales and pakistani . knumberg 's popular in the special administr region wa impress becaus hong kong enjoy be the third-largest produc of film by volum after india and the u.s. ===================================================== bhansali 's music heaven by aniruddh chawda devda ( univers , number ) . hindi film soundtrack . music : ismail darbar . lyric : nusrat badr for perhap the most eagerli anticip film of the year , filmmak sanjay leela bhansali 's devda had to deliv a score that not onli met the hype but also let ismail darbar prove that the mega-sel hum dil de chuke sanam wa no one-tim flash in the pan . by devis a semi-class , once-in-a-decad , number percent `` indian '' music score , bhansali and darbar emerg victori in bake and serv a number-lay monument soundtrack . what is most groundbreak is the power one-two punch of lyric by newcom nusrat badr and the from-soul-voic of first-tim shreya ghosal . ghosal 's voic , reminisc of both suman kalyanpur with a slightli thicker pitch and anuradha paudwal without the nasal monoton , is the most origin sing voic sinc kavita subramaniam appear in the mangeshkar mold . ghosal 's `` silsila ye chaahat ka '' is a sultri tabla-domin open to number minut of sheer music bliss . `` maar daala '' ( subramaniam , kk ) is an excel exampl of the use of classic raga to complement , rather than fill-in , interlud between vers . on '' kahe chhed , '' pandit birju maharaj , use hi own tune , add an intox open for madhuri dixit 's vocal and subramaniam to finish out a pierc song of long . while a combin of ghosal and subramaniam give life to on-screen lip-synch for madhuri dixit and aishwarya rai , on the male side udit narayan front for shah rukh khan . narayan 's on-target `` bairi piya , '' a duet with ghosal , could find compani in mani lata-rafi duet of yore . the up-tempo `` chalak chalak '' again smoothli float narayan with vinod rathod and ghosal while subramaniam and ghosal 's jugalbandhi on `` dola re dola '' simpli shake the rafter . packag in univers 's bombay plant , the earliest cd press have a cheap , paper-thin case . purist may consid replac the cheap cover with a store-bought sturdier one . at a suggest bombay retail valu of about dollarnumb and sell like hot cake statesid for dollarnumb a pop , devda is without doubt a huge profit-mak for the multin music market . but buyer bewar : avoid be distract by bootleg cd . thi except music and except well-record cd deserv unadulter music glori . pop in onli a properli copyright , origin cd and let darbar & co. whisk you away on a magic music ride . lifelong cinephil aniruddh chawda live , work , and write from wisconsin , on america 's north coast . httpaddr
