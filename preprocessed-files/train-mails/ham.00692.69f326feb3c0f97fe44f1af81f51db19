look at my friend jonathan 's compani , voxeo . unless you 're go to run out and build a platform that execut voic xml code and can support imap etc . then the easiest way to do thi is to leverag voxeo 's servic . you can start build on it for free and you will pay > dollarnumber.numb per minut for the pleasur of using/test the servic . httpaddr if you have about dollarnumberk to throw at the project then you can look at nuanc , which ha a platform that combin voicexml/vxml , speech reco , and the l & h speech synthes , which will allow you to have your email read to you by stephen hawk . tellm & bevoc have off-the-shelf servic that do thi , though , but from my test , they suck . if i were to build thi i 'd spec a lightweight imap client and voicexml browser and dump them on voxeo . howev , you 'll find thi to be extrem slow and frustrat . better to us a screen phone with a wap client . -ian . on wednesday , juli number , number , at number : number pm , mr. fork wrote : > i wa talk to a friend today about voic applic - use a > phone to > get mail or info ( other thing are possibl , but that 's what we talk > about ) . > he 's run a mail server call x-mail ( or someth ) and it ha > a web ui > written with some php page . i made the comment that rend an inbox > list with voxml ( or whatev the latest thing is ) would be > trivial & with > a littl play around you could do a simpl voic app to > monitor & admin > the mail server , or you could actual get/send mail thi way . > > the hard part is hook up to the phone system - how do i get a > phone to > hit a 'voic app server ' that hit the http+vox enabl mail server ? > he 'd want to give thi back as open sourc , but there is no > correspond > open sourc voic server - or is there ? > > i 've look at bevoc - it seem that talknumb is toast - doe > anybodi know > how els thi could be done ? > > i 'd love to see a digit answer machin with some speech > recognit > built-in that would proxi into a person comput for contact > list & mail > & whatnot . i could call /my/ home phone and bounc out to the web or do > whatev , without need a publicli avail voic server . > > > httpaddr httpaddr
