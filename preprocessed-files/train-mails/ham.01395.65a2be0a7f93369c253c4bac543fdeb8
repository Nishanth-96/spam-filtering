nf as a protocol is not known for it speedi but thi is absurd . i did an nf instal of a box thi morn ( that would be the box which wo n't boot from cd for those who were in irc ) and it wa rather slow but i just left it to it . have got it up , i want to copi the dvd to a disk on it so i have it handi for instal ani further bit i might requir . so i simpli mount the nf export dvd on the new box and start copi . after a coupl of minut i look - it wa transfer about numbermb a minut . so i kill that and use rsync instead which is tick away now at about number mb/min - still not exactli turbo charg but a lot better than the nf rate . ani idea as to what 's make it so slow ? there 's realli no point in run more nfsd process , as there is exactli one client , so i 'm a littl at a loss i must say . niall -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
