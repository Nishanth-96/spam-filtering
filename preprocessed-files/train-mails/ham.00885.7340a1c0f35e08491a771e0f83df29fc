( if you could actual put enough work into a one-ton mass , as it approach the speed of light , it would mass more , so you could still do it with a one-ton mass ; but we do n't have anyth approach that speed . ) the impuls requir is invers proport to the remain time to impact , so if we were to hit it after half the time ha elaps , we 'd need to acceler it by around number.numb cm/ instead . the gravit forc of an earth-siz mass could provid suffici deflect if that mass were about number.numberenumb time as far away from the asteroid as we are from earth 's center , or about number.numberenumb m , or about number.numb time the distanc from the earth to the sun ( number.numb au ) . ( and if that mass stay so nearbi for number year . ) the effect of continu acceler benefit greatli from plan ahead , sinc they scale with t^number , not t -- - and thu the need acceler scale with number/t^numb . after half the time ha elaps , we'd need four time as much acceler to make it miss the earth than if we were to start acceler it now . all of these number are a littl low , becaus the earth present a slightli easier target than it physic size suggest , due to it graviti well . how much easier depend on the speed of the projectil in way i do n't understand . they 're also a littl high , becaus they assum the forc is be appli pure at right angl to the asteroid 's current path , which is a slightli suboptim scenario ( although for veloc chang five order of magnitud smaller than the rel veloc , the differ is probabl insignific . ) and they assum there are no other effect on the asteroid 's path . what about electr charg ? could we electr charg the asteroid and anoth nearbi asteroid , perhap with electron beam , to provid the need acceler ? of cours , all of thi calcul could be appli in the other direct , too . if you want to sock a moon coloni with a one-ton asteroid , you could do it with a tini amount of forc appli over twenty-f year to adjust it orbit . *** about spam : i 'm sorri to admit i have n't implement ani of the better solut , and so i 'm afraid i 'll have to allow non-subscrib fork mail to be detain for scan . i hope thi measur can be revers soon when i have time to implement better measur . as ha often been note by other poster , measur to reduc spam sent to the fork list will not significantli decreas the spam load of forkpost , sinc the vast major of spam receiv by forkpost is sent to them directli , not through the fork list . -- kragen sitak silenc may not be golden , but at least it 's quiet . do n't speak unless you can improv the silenc . i have often regret my speech , never my silenc . -- ancient philosoph syru ( ? ) via adam rifkin , httpaddr
