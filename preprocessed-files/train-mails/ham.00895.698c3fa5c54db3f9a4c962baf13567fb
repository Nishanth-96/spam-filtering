'' ye , and eliza and i compos a precoci critiqu of the constitut of the unit state of america , too . we argu that it wa as good a scheme for miseri as ani , sinc it success in keep the common peopl reason happi and proud depend on the strength of the peopl themselv - and yet it describ no practic machineri which would tend to make the peopl , as oppos to their elect repres , strong . we said it wa possibl that the framer of the constitut were blind to the beauti of person who were without great wealth or power friend or public offic , but who were nonetheless genuin strong . we thought it wa more like , though , that the framer had not notic that it wa natur , and therefor almost inevit , that human be in extraordinari and endur situat should think of themselv as compos new famili . eliza and i point out that thi happen no less in democraci than in tyranni , sinc human be were the same the wide world over , and civil onli yesterday . elect repres , henc , could be expect to becom member of the famou and power famili of elect repres - which would , perfectli natur , make them wari and squeamish and stingi with respect to all the other sort of famili which , again , perfectli natur , subdivid mankind . eliza and i , think as halv of a singl geniu , propos that the constitut be amend so as to guarante that everi citizen , no matter how humbl or crazi or incompet or deform , somehow be given membership in some famili as covertli xenophob and crafti as the one their public servant form . good for eliza and me ! hi ho .
