but i *like* corn.. -- -- -- -- origin messag -- -- -- -- subject : [ interest ] fwd : when a crop becom king date : fri , number jul number number : number : number -number ( edt ) from : donald eastlak numberrd juli number , number when a crop becom king by michael pollan cornwal bridg , conn. -- here in southern new england the corn is alreadi waist high and grow so avidli you can almost hear the creak of stalk and leaf as the plant stretch toward the sun . the ear of sweet corn are just start to show up on local farm stand , inaugur one of the ceremoni of an american summer . these day the nation 's nearli number million-acr field of corn roll across the countrysid like a second great lawn , but thi wholesom , all-american imag obscur a decidedli more dubiou realiti . like the tulip , the appl and the potato , zea may ( the botan name for both sweet and feed corn ) ha evolv with human over the past number , number year or so in the great danc of speci we call domest . the plant gratifi human need , in exchang for which human expand the plant 's habitat , move it gene all over the world and remak the land ( clear tree , plow the ground , protect it from it enemi ) so it might thrive . corn , by make itself tasti and nutriti , got itself notic by christoph columbu , who help expand it rang from the new world to europ and beyond . today corn is the world 's most wide plant cereal crop . but nowher have human done quit as much to advanc the interest of thi plant as in north america , where zea may ha insinu itself into our landscap , our food system and our feder budget . one need look no further than the dollarnumb billion farm bill presid bush sign last month to wonder whose interest are realli be serv here . under the number-year program , taxpay will pay farmer dollarnumb billion a year to grow ever more corn , thi despit the fact that we struggl to get rid of the surplu the plant alreadi produc . the averag bushel of corn ( number pound ) sell for about dollarnumb today ; it cost farmer more than dollarnumb to grow it . but rather than design a program that would encourag farmer to plant less corn which would have the benefit of lift the price farmer receiv for it congress ha decid instead to subsid corn by the bushel , therebi insur that zea may dominion over it number , number-squar mile american habitat will go unchalleng . at first blush thi subsidi might look like a handout for farmer , but realli it 's a form of welfar for the plant itself -- and for all those econom interest that profit from it overproduct : the processor , factori farm , and the soft drink and snack maker that reli on cheap corn . for zea may ha triumph by make itself indispens not to farmer ( whom it is swiftli and sure bankrupt ) but to the archer daniel midland , tyson and coca-cola of the world . our entir food suppli ha undergon a process of `` cornif '' in recent year , without our even notic it . that 's becaus , unlik in mexico , where a corn-bas diet ha been the norm for centuri , in the unit state most of the corn we consum is invis , have been heavili process or pass through food anim befor it reach us . most of the anim we eat ( chicken , pig and cow ) today subsist on a diet of corn , regardless of whether it is good for them . in the case of beef cattl , which evolv to eat grass , a corn diet wreak havoc on their digest system , make it necessari to feed them antibiot to stave off ill and infect . even farm-rais salmon are be bred to toler corn not a food their evolut ha prepar them for . whi feed fish corn ? becaus it 's the cheapest thing you can feed ani anim , thank to feder subsidi . but even with more than half of the number billion bushel of corn produc annual be fed to anim , there is plenti left over . so compani like a.d.m. , cargil and conagra have figur ingeni new way to dispos of it , turn it into everyth from ethanol to vitamin c and biodegrad plastic . by far the best strategi for keep zea may in busi ha been the develop of high-fructos corn syrup , which ha all but push sugar asid . sinc the number 's , most soft drink manufactur have switch from sugar to corn sweeten , as have most snack maker . nearli number percent of the calori american consum now come from corn sweeten ; the figur is number percent for mani children . add to that all the corn-bas anim protein ( corn-f beef , chicken and pork ) and the corn qua corn ( chip , muffin , sweet corn ) and you have a plant that ha becom one of natur 's greatest success stori , by turn us ( along with sever other equal unwit speci ) into an expand race of corn eater . so whi begrudg corn it phenomen success ? is n't thi the way domest is suppos to work ? the problem in corn 's case is that we 're sacrif the health of both our bodi and the environ by grow and eat so much of it . though we 're onli begin to understand what our cornifi food system is do to our health , there 's caus for concern . it 's probabl no coincid that the wholesal switch to corn sweeten in the number' mark the begin of the epidem of obes and type number diabet in thi countri . sweet becam so cheap that soft drink maker , rather than lower their price , super-s their serv portion and market budget . thousand of new sweeten snack food hit the market , and the amount of fructos in our diet soar . thi would be bad enough for the american waistlin , but there 's also preliminari research suggest that high-fructos corn syrup is metabol differ than other sugar , make it potenti more harm . a recent studi at the univers of minnesota found that a diet high in fructos ( as compar to glucos ) elev triglycerid level in men shortli after eat , a phenomenon that ha been link to an increas risk of obes and heart diseas . littl is known about the health effect of eat anim that have themselv eaten so much corn , but in the case of cattl , research have found that corn-f beef is higher in satur fat than grass-f beef . we know a lot more about what number million acr of corn is do to the health of our environ : seriou and last damag . modern corn hybrid are the greediest of plant , demand more nitrogen fertil than ani other crop . corn requir more pesticid than ani other food crop . runoff from these chemic find it way into the groundwat and , in the midwestern corn belt , into the mississippi river , which carri it to the gulf of mexico , where it ha alreadi kill off marin life in a number , number squar mile area . to produc the chemic we appli to our cornfield take vast amount of oil and natur ga . ( nitrogen fertil is made from natur ga , pesticid from oil . ) america 's corn crop might look like a sustain , solar-pow system for produc food , but it is actual a huge , ineffici , pollut machin that guzzl fossil fuel -- a half a gallon of it for everi bushel . so it seem corn ha inde becom king . we have given it more of our land than ani other plant , an area more than twice the size of new york state . to keep it well fed and safe from predat we dous it with chemic that poison our water and deepen our depend on foreign oil . and then in order to dispos of all the corn thi crack system ha produc , we eat it as fast as we can in as mani way as we can turn the fat of the land into , well , fat . one ha to wonder whether corn ha n't at last succeed in domest us . ====== michael pollan is the author , most recent , of `` the botani of desir : a plant's-ey view of the world .
