> quicki for shell scripter : > how do i find out the time a file wa creat at ? there is no canon test , and the inform is not necessarili avail . if you check out how struct stat is defin on your system , you 'll find that onli time_t st_atim ; /* time of last access */ time_t st_mtime ; /* time of last data modif */ time_t st_ctime ; /* time of last file statu chang */ /* time measur in second sinc */ /* number : number : number utc , jan. number , number */ are avail . file statu chang = i-nod statu chang , it includ creation , mode chang , ownership chang etc. , so thi is what you want onli if the file statu wa n't chang sinc creation . thi inform is also shown by ls -lc , but pars ls ' output requir a bit of effort . i 'd rather recommend to write a short c program to access the file statu directli , and output the ctime directli ( second sinc the epoch , i.e . perfect for numer comparison ) . ( anoth way is to use gnu find -printf with a custom format : ... % c file 's last statu chang time in the format return by the c `ctime ' function . ... ) -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
