quot paul linehan emailaddr > what is the gpl all about then ? ( number ) i 'm sure you are not _actually_ under the delus that everyth on a typic linux distribut issu subject to the term of the gnu gpl . for one thing , it seem difficult to imagin you _not_ be awar that xfreenumb is under the x/mit licenc , that perl is under the perl artist licenc , that apach is under the apach licenc , and that numer bsd util are under the bsd licenc . furthermor , xv , acrobat reader , pine , pico , netscap commun , and a whole slew of other applic typic includ are n't under ani open sourc licenc at all , but rather are proprietari . ( number ) you seem , in ani event , to be under a misconcept as to what the gpl provid , as to code under it umbrella . it say ( in part ) that _if_ you have law receiv a copi of cover binari code , then you may insist on one of certain form of access to the match sourc code . pleas note that it doe _not_ guarante you ani right whatsoev if nobodi 's decid to give you a law copi . > but *_surely_* they can not bsd linux ? it 's not their to bsd ! again , you seem to be under a misconcept . if you check , i 'm quit confid you 'll see that suse are in full complianc with gpl v. number' source-cod access provis concern gpled code includ in their distribut . and no , nobodi ha the legal right to alter licenc term to someon els 's copyright properti . but you have not cite ani reason to believ that suse have done ani of those thing . > fine - nobodi can oblig suse to do anyth other than put up the ftp > version , but sure they ca n't prevent a cd owner from burn a copi > and give it to me ? see below . you and the cd owner would be commit copyright violat . suse linux ag are rather unlik to knock down your door and haul you down to a judg , if that 's what you 're ask . > nobodi can oblig them to give away anyth other than ftp - i 'm not > ask for that . i 'm ask for somebodi who ha linux ( gpl'ed ) to > burn a copi for me and give it to me in exchang for a reason > consider ( say , the price of the cd and a bottl of frascati or a > coupl of pint ? ) . you appear confus between linux the kernel ( which is a copyright work to which sourc code access is guarante under the gnu gpl if you 've receiv a law copi of a binari version ) and the rather imprecis concept of a `` linux distribut '' , which is a number of work under divers licenc term collect onto some media . in the case of suse 's box set -- which are not law to duplic and redistribut in their entireti -- at least a coupl of the applic on them ( yast , yastnumb , and the instal program ) are proprietari copyright work of suse linux ag . in the gener case , duplic and redistribut cd-rom contain those work is copyright infring . illeg . no amount of hand-wav about the gnu gpl is go to chang that . ( suse permit peopl to duplic and redistribut the `` evalu '' and '' live-ev '' cd edit , despit that fact , as long as it is not `` for valu '' . ) if you want to have a suse box set to instal from , buy one . > what doe the gpl mean now ? suggest : read it . i would guess you 've not yet done so . -- cheer , live faust , die jung . rick moen emailaddr -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
