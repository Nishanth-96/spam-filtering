'' rrrrrrriiiiiight ... . httpaddr juli number , number realnetwork pose challeng to microsoft by john markoff san francisco , juli number -- in a signific challeng to microsoft , realnetwork plan to announc a new version of it softwar on monday that can distribut audio and video in a rang of format , includ microsoft 's own proprietari window media . the new softwar is intend for larg media compani and other corpor that need to send audio and video data to custom and employe in a varieti of differ format . but realnetwork acknowledg that it wa possibl that the compani might incur microsoft 's legal wrath . nevertheless , rob glaser , a former microsoft execut who found realnetwork as progress network in number , said he believ the strategi wa good for both microsoft and consum . `` a ration way for them to respond would be to say , `thi is great , ' `` he said . `` that would be microsoft of the futur . '' mr. glaser said hi compani , base in seattl , had develop a version of the microsoft media server softwar that come with the window oper system . he said realnetwork ' engin had studi the data that wa sent between the microsoft media server softwar and the window media player program and recreat the technolog need to play file in the microsoft format . thi method creat a so-cal clean-room version , mean the develop built the transmiss softwar without ani knowledg about the underli program . microsoft ha adopt a similar strategi at sever junctur , mr. glaser said , reverse-engin technolog like netwar , postscript and javascript at differ time . microsoft execut said the compani current licens the window media player technolog to a varieti of compani includ yahoo , realnetwork and the america onlin unit of aol time warner . but a microsoft execut said that a clean-room copi of the window server technolog could lead to qualiti and perform issu . `` it 's kind of hard to specul about the technolog until we see it , '' said dave fester , the gener manag of the window media divis . if a compani ha not licens the server softwar , he ad , `` we would need to look at it and see what they 're do . '' realnetwork appear to be endeavor to avoid be `` netscap , '' a refer to the fate that befel the netscap commun corpor when microsoft decid to make an internet browser , which wa pioneer commerci by netscap , a standard part of the window oper system . netscap wa later acquir by aol time warner . microsoft 's decis to build an internet browser into window and give it away at no addit cost led directli to a bitter antitrust lawsuit brought by the justic depart in number . realnetwork , which wa a pioneer in the market for stream media to desktop person comput , ha been under grow pressur from microsoft , which is give away both the server and window media player program as part of it oper strategi . realnetwork also face challeng from appl comput , which offer the quicktim media player as a part of it macintosh os x oper system and sell a more full-featur player . moreov , in recent month macromedia inc. , which make the flash anim softwar use on mani web site , ha ad video capabl to it technolog , make it a potenti rival . realnetwork is gambl that with a prolifer of differ standard and format for video and audio , the media corpor that make content avail over the internet will flock to a singl system that support multipl type of data . the compani is tri to shift the focu of the competit from the pc desktop to the server , accord to analyst . sever analyst said the realnetwork shift in strategi could put microsoft on the defens . `` real ha got the experi and sophist to pull thi off , '' said richard doherti , the presid of envision , a market research and consult firm base in seaford , n.y. `` it will open up a new hors race . '' until now the compani have been engag in a technolog war to rapidli increas the power and qualiti of each of their media player . at the same time , they have compet over which of the program are place on the desktop of person comput user . realnetwork claim to have number , number subscrib for pay servic , but it is perceiv as be increasingli vulner , accord to some analyst , becaus microsoft ha includ it media player as part of the window oper system , which domin the pc market . there are dozen of data format for play audio and video on the internet , but the domin one are realaudio and realvideo from realnetwork , quicktim from appl , window media from microsoft and the industri digit movi standard mpeg-numb and mpeg-numb . microsoft and realnetwork are current lock in a close race for desktop media player leadership . in the first quarter of thi year , accord to survey data collect by jupit research , a market research firm base in new york , realnetwork ' realon player had a number.numb percent share of media player , while microsoft 's window media player had a number.numb percent share . appl 's quicktim player wa third , with a number.numb percent . the new server softwar from realnetwork is part of a version of the compani 's media server that is to be introduc on monday and which will be call the helix univers server . realnetwork said it would offer perform data base on a test it financ at an independ test servic , keylab , that indic that the helix softwar can , under some condit , deliv up to four time the speed of the window media server in microsoft 's oper system . ( softwar server are program that run on power comput and can send stream of digit inform to mani comput user simultan . ) at a news confer schedul to be held in san francisco , realnetwork is also expect to announc that it plan to make the helix softwar avail as part of a strategi known as commun sourc , which will make it possibl for realnetwork partner and competitor to take advantag of the origin programm ' instruct . realnetwork is to announc a rang of partner , includ hitachi , hewlett-packard , i.b.m. , deutsch telekom , nec , nokia , cisco system , oracl , sun microsystem , palm , texa instrument and other . these partner could then incorpor the softwar into their own hardwar and softwar product . under the licens strategi , compani will be abl to freeli gain access to the underli code that the helix program is base on , but they will still pay a licens fee when they sell commerci product base on the technolog . the community-sourc approach to softwar , which wa pioneer by sun to distribut it java program languag , is a variat upon the origin free softwar or open-sourc approach which ha confound the softwar industri in recent year . while open-sourc softwar can be freeli share , with some restrict , the community-sourc approach is more restrict and yet still tri to persuad other to collabor and add innov idea . other larg technolog compani includ sun , i.b.m . and appl , have all now adopt variat on such open-sourc strategi , with vari result . in sun 's case , the compani ha been critic becaus , while java ha becom an industri standard , the compani ha not been the princip financi beneficiari in mani case . realnetwork is tri to strike a balanc between open up it technolog to persuad other to particip and innov and not lose control of the technolog entir , mr. glaser said . `` we think we'v struck the balanc well , '' he said . analyst said the strategi shift by realnetwork wa like to shake up the industri . `` the moment you 've open-sourc someth you 've corner your competitor , '' said matthew berk , an analyst a jupit research . `` to date thi stuff ha been veri proprietari . open it up make it access to creativ and gift programm who will come up with wild stuff that the compani have never consid . '' mr. glaser said he expect other compani to produc technolog that would rival realnetwork ' commerci as a result of the community-sourc strategi . one possibl is that compani such as sun or i.b.m . could decid to add the helix technolog of realnetwork as a standard compon of their oper system . although realnetwork might not get a signific financi benefit from such an arrang it could contribut to make it helix softwar a de facto industri standard . mr. glaser said he had struck upon the idea of make hi media server softwar open sourc while visit with an execut from nokia , the world 's largest cellphon maker . `` take all of thi stuff beyond the pc ha been a huge motiv for us , '' he said . when he realiz that nokia wa interest in deploy the softwar technolog on as mani as number to number differ type of phone , he realiz that realnetwork did not have enough program talent to support the effort . `` i told him , `i do n't think we have enough engin even if you guy were will to pay us , ' `` he said . that touch off a search for an altern way of have the two compani cooper . httpaddr real take the open-sourc rout by jim hu staff writer , cnet news.com juli number , number , number : number pm pt realnetwork on monday unveil a new open-sourc version of it stream media technolog that support multipl file format for audio and video , includ those that use microsoft 's window media technolog . the new campaign , dub `` helix , '' and first report by the new york time , mark one of the most ambiti move in the company' histori . realnetwork is simultan releas technolog without permiss that plug in to microsoft 's compet softwar and is rais the hood on much of it own softwar technolog to `` open sourc '' develop or anyon els who want to look . the twin move rais the risk of lawsuit and renew competit -- potenti even from redmond , wash.-bas microsoft itself , onc it get a look under the hood at realnetwork ' technolog . but it mark a dramat , potenti way for a compani watch it market share diminish to regain momentum and support across an industri where mani other player remain skeptic of microsoft 's power . `` it 's a veri bold move on the part of real , '' said michael gartenberg , a research director for analyst firm jupit research . `` thi wa a shot fire by real and fire directli at redmond . '' the move is the latest in a seri of strateg twist and turn that ha made realnetwork one of the onli compani to surviv direct microsoft competit for year . while the compani ha expand into paid subscript content busi , it softwar and stream media infrastructur have been under increas pressur from microsoft , which ha deem multimedia to be one of the major drive under the latest version of it window oper system . real 's helix announc mainli involv the technolog that allow media file to move from place to place over the internet . realnetwork and microsoft both produc server that allow video and audio to be stream from a content compani such as cnn or nbc to a person comput . real ha charg for thi softwar , while microsoft ha given it away for free . in april , realmedia reach number million at-hom viewer , compar with window media at number.numb million and appl comput 's quicktim at number.numb million , accord to nielsen/netr . at work , window media drew about number.numb million uniqu viewer , compar with realmedia 's number.numb million and quicktim 's number million . real 's own new product , call the univers server , will allow one server to stream real 's technolog , microsoft file , appl computer' quicktim , and other . most other compet product do not support competitor ' technolog . `` when you have all these differ platform , and all these differ protocol , it get unmanag , '' realnetwork ' rob glaser said at a high-glitz press confer in san francisco announc the product . `` a lot of what ( thi technolog ) is about is break those bottleneck and make converg realli converg . '' to make the new product compat with microsoft file , howev , the compani pursu a riski strategi known as `` revers engin , '' in which develop examin a competitor 's product to see how it work and tri to creat someth that work just like it . glaser said that engin work entir in a `` clean room '' environ , mean that they had no access to actual microsoft code . had they simpli copi code , they could be liabl for patent infring . the result product simpli mimic the way that microsoft 's file are sent across network and allow a window media player to receiv the file . other compani have been su for simpli copi a competitor 's code and put it in their own product . but realnetwork say it 's not worri about microsoft lawsuit , becaus it took precaut to do all develop in the `` clean room '' environ . microsoft itself ha engag in thi kind of legal revers engin . analyst say microsoft , which still face antitrust lawsuit , is in no posit to sue in ani case . `` thi is a veri tenuou time for microsoft , '' gartenberg said . `` thi is not a time in microsoft 's histori when it can be seen as tri to do to real what it did to netscap . '' the influenti giant ? certainli , monday 's announc acknowledg microsoft 's influenc in media technolog , someth glaser and real have often been loath to do . microsoft wa quick to spin monday 's announc as further valid of it strength in the marketplac . `` it 's an admiss of realnetwork that it 's import for them to support window media and that we 're now the lead player among home and work user , '' said michael aldridg , lead product manag for microsoft 's window digit media divis . aldridg ad that realnetwork current ha a licens agreement for it media player to support window audio and video format . howev , realnetwork and microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server to deliv window media format to end user , which is what realnetwork tri to do . aldridg declin to comment on realnetwork ' replic of microsoft' technolog . in addit to it own new product , real ha promis to give away sourc code to much of the underli technolog for stream media . that stop short of the actual file format , or `` codec '' itself , but will provid the open-sourc commun and other compani with power new tool to build their own stream media player or softwar . glaser said he would n't initi make the softwar code that mimic microsoft 's stream avail but that he wa consid the idea . a first chunk of code underli the realnetwork multimedia player softwar will be releas in number day . other code , includ the basic function of it stream media server and encod , will be releas by the end of the year , the compani said . the compani 's plan to reveal it sourc code -- the basic instruct underli the softwar -- echo similar move made by netscap commun to defend against microsoft . in march number , netscap took the bold step of open it sourc code to allow softwar develop to help creat the next gener of it popular browser . jame barksdal , then ceo of netscap , said the move would allow the compani to `` tap into a virtual unlimit develop talent pool . '' instead , the effort , which ha evolv into the mozilla.org project , hit consider roadblock , and microsoft overtook netscap in market share . -- -- emailaddr -- .sig doubl play ! we have done a great job of have team work around the clock to deliv secur fix for ani problem that aris . our respons ha been unmatch - but as an industri leader we can and must do better ... go forward , we must develop technolog and polici that help busi better manag ever larger network of pc , server and other intellig devic , know that their critic busi system are safe from harm . system will have to becom self-manag and inher resili . we need to prepar now for the kind of softwar that will make thi happen , and we must be the kind of compani that peopl can reli on to deliv it . -- bill gate , httpaddr the problem with soap is that it tri to escap from the web interfac . it deliber attempt to suck , mostli becaus it is deliber tri to supplant cgi-lik applic rather than web-lik applic . it is simpli a wast of time for folk to say that `` http allow thi becaus i 've seen it use by thi common cgi script .
