well , thank everyon for the explan . i still disagre with the reason , but it seem thi is one of those philosoph question that i 'm on the lose end of : ) the checkinstal util that someon mention seem use , but i do n't realli have the time to figur it out right now . after search the web some more , i found out that mandrak 's version of rpm is patch to support what i want . so i guess i 'll look into that when i get a chanc . on thu , aug number , number at number : number : numberpm +number , ralf ertzing wrote : > do noth in the % build section , and copi the exist binari > in % instal . as far as i can tell , thi could be use for my situat too . it 's not a complet solut sinc i ca n't realli distribut the srpm with full certainti that they work , but at least i can make rpm for local use by tar up the buildroot directori and then use the abov techniqu . all i realli want is to get depend track for everyth instal on my system ( includ softwar from cv ) . thi just make it a littl bit faster . gari _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list httpaddr
