'' blake , who move to siberia after finish colleg with an econom degre , ha a breezi write style . and although hi book is flaw in mani respect , it doe includ some sharp observ of life in russia . `` usual with construct , '' he tell us , for instanc , `` you have two choic : number ) you can do it quickli , or number ) you can do it right . the soviet construct worker . . . take hi time do thing wrong . '' anyon who ha spent time in siberia know that it inhabit are a breed apart . they disdain their compatriot in the countri 's western region and pride themselv -- perhap excess -- on their courag , strength and inner fortitud . siberia , in fact , occupi a space in the russian nation psych similar to that of the wild west in american mytholog . the effort throughout the numberth and numberth centuri to settl siberia 's vast expans and exploit it natur resourc still reson with russian . so doe the region 's role as a conveni dump ground for crimin and polit dissid dure the czarist centuri and as home to the cruel network of gulag in soviet time . unfortun , littl of thi rich brew of histori and myth make an appear in siberia bound . neither do lot of other pertin fact . russian often say that , in russia , anyth can happen -- and usual doe . so it 's easi to believ that two young men could establish a chocol busi on littl more than hope , smart and chutzpah . but while blake describ establish a cocoa-bean import busi with hi friend sasha , we never learn how they met in the first place or whi he believ sasha to be a trustworthi associ . the two of them strike a deal to sell their bean to a local chocol factori , yet we find out virtual noth about the chocol the factori produc . is it tasti ? disgust ? are we talk chocol bar , chocol truffl or chocol syrup ? a few detail would go a long way here . the author ha the make of a terrif stori . but even though siberia bound includ frequent humor episod , blake gener fail to transform the pungent ingredi into a satisfi meal . the constant descript of encount and convers ultim differ littl from one anoth . peopl are forev wink , smirk and slap one anoth on the back . slam down shot of vodka and make sentiment toast to women and friendship play an inevit role in ani account of russian life , but read about such occas becom tiresom after the numberth or numberth repetit . blake is also given to facil comment that are meant to sound smart but often fall flat . `` democraci and the free market , the best institut the west had to offer , storm over the border and ran deep into russia , '' he tell us . `` but like all foreign armi throughout histori , they quickli were spread too thin and becam dilut . '' and then there 's thi summat of hi time in russia : `` those four year have left me with a lifetim of rabid ambival to chew on until i 've got no teeth left . '' blake manag to includ a few unpleas -- and wholli unnecessari -- laugh at the expens of chines worker and gay . and although i like wordplay as much as the next guy , it 's jar when non-english-speak charact make pun in english . `` in a pinch , '' say one charact , a chocol factori director who warn blake not to store extra cocoa bean on site , `` i 'm afraid we would probabl take a pinch . '' some of these fault would n't matter if siberia bound were a picaresqu novel or an account that did n't aspir to authent . but the effect here is to undermin a reader 's faith in the narrat 's reliabl and to reduc most of the charact to the stock figur encount in dozen of other account of russian life . so in the end , i believ the broad contour of blake 's stori but found it hard to take serious mani of the particular . and hi ultim conclus -- that capit , materi comfort and wealth do not bring happi -- hardli qualifi as a revel . david tuller is a contribut writer at salon.com and the author of '' crack in the iron closet : travel in gay and lesbian russia .
