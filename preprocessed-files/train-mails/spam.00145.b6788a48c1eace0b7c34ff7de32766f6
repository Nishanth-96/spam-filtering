the `` next page '' tab is right next to one that say `` bookmark thi page '' - no inform until you mouseov the tab to tell you you are enter the site . i felt a littl overwhelm with glitz - anim gif 's overemphas word etc and not enough inform on your open page . ~~~~ i also surpris to see a site for florida rental with a url end with .uk . ; recommend for thi site . number . on the home page a person 's eye are drawn first to the anim and red text on the yellow background , miss the first sentenc . remov the anim and add more detail to thi import introduct . instead of use the 'click here ' button , just have a text link follow directli after the introduct . number . on the second page , have all your link the same color , and all your text a differ color . do n't confus peopl on what is a link and what they need to read . underlin text on the internet can often be confus for a link , expeci when it is in the normal blue link color . ; have the import link in red and with the flash arrow is overkil . number . on the rest of the site , you have good inform , but you do n't need the top menu bar when use the frame menu and the page are all untitl . i hope you do n't think i 'm be too harsh , i just know you want the best site you can have and i think these chang will make a world of differ . ; onc a person get into the site you have the inform organ and complet . i even want to come and stay ! ~~~~ the anim make thi site look amateurish from the begin . ; the flash `` bookmark thi site '' make me want to leav instead of come back ! ; the font comic san ms also look veri kiddi . ; much could be done to improv thi site . ~~~~ i wa confus by thi site . there are four anim gif on the first screen , and so my eye kept flick back and forth between them . i read over the paragraph of inform , but did n't know where to click . i final figur out the 'click here ' button should have been up by the text and that is where i should go . on the numbernd page , again too mani flash gif . ; other than that , the numbernd page wa much easier to find my way around . one suggest , if you 're use frame it is unneccessari to have the menu of link list both on one frame and at the top of the page as wa shown on the 'special offer ' page . the font style and bright color made the site look casual and laid back , like a trip to florida should be , so that wa good . besid the flash gif , by the time i left i like thi site , but if i had n't been review it i do n't know if i would have gotten that far . ~~~~ thi site is bright and breezi . it is veri clean , easi to read and navig . logic present and information-rich . some page had too mani anim imag for my own tast , but the page are happi and cheeri . tip : if you can get a hold of paintshop pro , you can take out the white squar that form a background for some imag . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moder : ami mossel ; moder post : ; ; emailaddr ______________________________________________________ send post and question ( or your answer ) to : ; ; emailaddr pleas send suggest and comment to : ; ; emailaddr to chang your subscrib address , send both new and old address to emailaddr see below for unsubscrib instruct . copyright number aeopublish -- -- - end of your membership exchang thi email wa sent to emailaddr at your request , by your membership newslett servic . visit our subscript center to edit your interest or unsubscrib . view our privaci polici . power by -- number.number.javamail.rovadmin.rovwebnumb --
