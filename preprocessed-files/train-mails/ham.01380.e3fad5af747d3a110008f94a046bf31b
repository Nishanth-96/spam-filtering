( thi bug did not affect normal oper -- - it just made it hard to tell when you were tri to use unison incorrectli with an old version of the server , sinc it would hang instead of give an error messag . ) chang sinc number.number.numb : * chang fastcheck from a boolean to a string prefer . it legal valu are ye ( for a fast check ) , no ( for a safe check ) , or default ( for a fast check -- -which also happen to be safe -- -when run on unix and a safe check when on window ) . the default is default . * sever prefer have been renam for consist . all prefer name are now spell out in lowercas . for backward compat , the old name still work , but they are not mention in the manual ani more . * the temp file creat by the 'diff ' and 'merg ' command are now name by prepend a new prefix to the file name , rather than append a suffix . thi should avoid confus diff/merg program that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file content . * we now set the keepal option on the server socket , to make sure that the server time out if the commun link is unexpectedli broken . * bug fix : + when updat small file , unison now close the destin file . + file permiss are properli updat when the file is behind a follow link . + sever other small fix . chang sinc number.number.numb : * major window perform improv ! we 've ad a prefer fastcheck that make unison look onli at a file 's creation time and last-modifi time to check whether it ha chang . thi should result in a huge speedup when check for updat in larg replica . when thi switch is set , unison will use file creation time as 'pseudo inod number ' when scan window replica for updat , instead of read the full content of everi file . thi may caus unison to miss propag an updat if the creat time , modif time , and length of the file are all unchang by the updat ( thi is not easi to achiev , but it can be done ) . howev , unison will never overwrit such an updat with a chang from the other replica , sinc it alway doe a safe check for updat just befor propag a chang . thu , it is reason to use thi switch most of the time and occasion run unison onc with fastcheck set to fals , if you are worri that unison may have overlook an updat . warn : thi chang is ha not yet been thoroughli field-test . if you set the fastcheck prefer , pay care attent to what unison is do . * new function : central backup and merg + thi version incorpor two piec of major new function , implement by sylvain roy dure a summer internship at penn : a central backup facil that keep a full backup of ( select file in ) each replica , and a merg featur that allow unison to invok an extern file-merg tool to resolv conflict chang to individu file . + central backup : o unison now maintain full backup of the last-synchron version of ( some of ) the file in each replica ; these function both as backup in the usual sens and as the `` common version '' when invok extern merg program . o the back up file are store in a directori /.unison/backup on each host . ( the name of thi directori can be chang by set the environ variabl unisonbackupdir . ) o the predic backup control which file are actual back up : give the prefer 'backup = path *' caus back up of all file . o file are ad to the backup directori whenev unison updat it archiv . thi mean that # when unison reconstruct it archiv from scratch ( e.g. , becaus of an upgrad , or becaus the archiv file have been manual delet ) , all file will be back up . # otherwis , each file will be back up the first time unison propag an updat for it . o the prefer backupvers control how mani previou version of each file are kept . the default is number ( i.e. , the last synchron version plu one backup ) . o for backward compat , the backup prefer is also still support , but backup is now prefer . o it is ok to manual delet file from the backup directori ( or to throw away the directori itself ) . befor unison use ani of these file for anyth import , it check that it fingerprint match the one that it expect . + merg : o both user interfac offer a new 'merg ' command , invok by press 'm ' ( with a chang file select ) . o the actual merg is perform by an extern program . the prefer merg and mergenumb control how thi program is invok . if a backup exist for thi file ( see the backup prefer ) , then the merg prefer is use for thi purpos ; otherwis mergenumb is use . in both case , the valu of the prefer should be a string repres the command that should be pass to a shell to invok the merg program . within thi string , the special substr currentnumb , currentnumb , new , and old may appear at ani point . unison will substitut these as follow befor invok the command : # currentnumb is replac by the name of the local copi of the file ; # currentnumb is replac by the name of a temporari file , into which the content of the remot copi of the file have been transfer by unison prior to perform the merg ; # new is replac by the name of a temporari file that unison expect to be written by the merg program when it finish , give the desir new content of the file ; and # old is replac by the name of the back up copi of the origin version of the file ( i.e. , it state at the end of the last success run of unison ) , if one exist ( appli onli to merg , not mergenumb ) . for exampl , on unix system set the merg prefer to merg = diffnumb -m currentnumb old currentnumb > new will tell unison to use the extern diffnumb program for merg . a larg number of extern merg program are avail . for exampl , emac user may find the follow conveni : mergenumb = emac -q -- eval ' ( ediff-merge-fil `` currentnumb '' `` currentnumb '' nil `` new '' ) ' merg = emac -q -- eval ' ( ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor `` currentnumb '' `` currentnumb '' `` old '' nil `` new '' ) ' ( these command are display here on two line to avoid run off the edg of the page . in your prefer file , each should be written on a singl line . ) o if the extern program exit without leav ani file at the path new , unison consid the merg to have fail . if the merg program write a file call new but exit with a non-zero statu code , then unison consid the merg to have succeed but to have gener conflict . in thi case , it attempt to invok an extern editor so that the user can resolv the conflict . the valu of the editor prefer control what editor is invok by unison . the default is emac . o pleas send us suggest for other use valu of the mergenumb and merg prefer -- we 'd like to give sever exampl in the manual . * smaller chang : + when one prefer file includ anoth , unison no longer add the suffix '.prf ' to the includ file by default . if a file with precis the given name exist in the .unison directori , it will be use ; otherwis unison will add .prf , as it did befor . ( thi chang mean that includ prefer file can be name blah.includ instead of blah.prf , so that unison will not offer them in it 'choos a prefer file' dialog . ) + for linux system , we now offer both a static link and a dynam link execut . the static one is larger , but will probabl run on more system , sinc it doesn't depend on the same version of dynam link librari modul be avail . + fix the forc and prefer prefer , which were get the propag direct exactli backward . + fix a bug in the startup code that would caus unison to crash when the default profil ( ~/.unison/default.prf ) doe not exist . + fix a bug where , on the run when a profil is first creat , unison would confusingli display the root in revers order in the user interfac . * for develop : + we 've ad a modul depend diagram to the sourc distribut , in src/dependencies.p , to help new prospect develop with navig the code . chang sinc number.number.numb : * incompat chang : archiv format ha chang . * incompat chang : the startup sequenc ha been complet rewritten and greatli simplifi . the main user-vis chang is that the defaultpath prefer ha been remov . it effect can be approxim by use multipl profil , with includ direct to incorpor common set . all use of defaultpath in exist profil should be chang to path . anoth chang in startup behavior that will affect some user is that it is no longer possibl to specifi root both in the profil and on the command line . you can achiev a similar effect , though , by break your profil into two : default.prf = root = blah root = foo includ common common.prf = now do unison common rootnumb rootnumb when you want to specifi root explicitli . * the -prefer and -forc option have been extend to allow user to specifi that file with more recent modtim should be propag , write either -prefer newer or -forc newer . ( for symmetri , unison will also accept -prefer older or -forc older . ) the -forc older/new option can onli be use when -time is also set . the graphic user interfac provid access to these facil on a one-off basi via the action menu . * name of root can now be `` alias '' to allow replica to be reloc without chang the name of the archiv file where unison store inform between run . ( thi featur is for expert onli . see the `` archiv file '' section of the manual for more inform . ) * graphic user-interfac : + a new command is provid in the synchron menu for switch to a new profil without restart unison from scratch . + the gui also support one-key shortcut for commonli use profil . if a profil contain a prefer of the form 'key = n ' , where n is a singl digit , then press thi key will caus unison to immedi switch to thi profil and begin synchron again from scratch . ( ani action that may have been select for a set of chang current be display will be discard . ) + each profil may includ a prefer 'label = ' give a descript string that describ the option select in thi profil . the string is list along with the profil name in the profil select dialog , and display in the top-right corner of the main unison window . * minor : + fix a bug that would sometim caus the 'diff ' display to order the file backward rel to the main user interfac . ( thank to pascal brisset for thi fix . ) + on unix system , the graphic version of unison will check the display variabl and , if it is not set , automat fall back to the textual user interfac . + synchron path ( path prefer ) are now match against the ignor prefer . so if a path is both specifi in a path prefer and ignor , it will be skip . + numer other bugfix and small improv . chang sinc number.number.numb : * the synchron of modif time ha been disabl for directori . * prefer file may now includ line of the form includ , which will caus name.prf to be read at that point . * the synchron of permiss between window and unix now work properli . * a bind cygwin=binmod in now ad to the environ so that the cygwin port of openssh work properli in a non-cygwin context . * the servercmd and addversionno prefer can now be use togeth : -addversionno append an appropri -nnn to the server command , which is found by use the valu of the -servercmd prefer if there is one , or els just unison . * both '-pref=val ' and '-pref val ' are now allow for boolean valu . ( the former can be use to set a prefer to fals . ) * lot of small bug fix . chang sinc number.number.numb : * the log prefer is now set to true by default , sinc the log file seem use for most user . * sever miscellan bugfix ( most involv symlink ) . chang sinc number.number.numb : * incompat chang : archiv format ha chang ( again ) . * sever signific bug introduc in number.number.numb have been fix . chang sinc number.number.numb : * incompat chang : archiv format ha chang . make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad , to avoid spuriou conflict . the first sync after upgrad will be slow . * new function : + unison now synchron file modtim , user-id , and group-id . these new featur are control by a set of new prefer , all of which are current fals by default . o when the time prefer is set to true , file modif time are propag . ( becaus the represent of time may not have the same granular on both replica , unison may not alway be abl to make the modtim precis equal , but it will get them as close as the oper system involv allow . ) o when the owner prefer is set to true , file ownership inform is synchron . o when the group prefer is set to true , group inform is synchron . o when the numericid prefer is set to true , owner and group inform is synchron numer . by default , owner and group number are convert to name on each replica and these name are synchron . ( the special user id number and the special group number are never map via user/group name even if thi prefer is not set . ) + ad an integer-valu prefer perm that can be use to control the propag of permiss bit . the valu of thi prefer is a mask indic which permiss bit should be synchron . it is set by default to numberonumb : all bit but the set-uid and set-gid bit are synchronis ( synchron these latter bit can be a secur hazard ) . if you want to synchron all bit , you can set the valu of thi prefer to -number . + ad a log prefer ( default fals ) , which make unison keep a complet record of the chang it make to the replica . by default , thi record is written to a file call unison.log in the user 's home directori ( the valu of the home environ variabl ) . if you want it someplac els , set the logfil prefer to the full pathnam you want unison to use . + ad an ignorenot prefer that maintain a set of pattern for path that should definit not be ignor , whether or not they match an ignor pattern . ( that is , a path will now be ignor iff it match an ignor pattern and doe not match ani ignorenot pattern . ) * user-interfac improv : + root are now display in the user interfac in the same order as they were given on the command line or in the prefer file . + when the batch prefer is set , the graphic user interfac no longer wait for user confirm when it display a warn messag : it simpli pop up an advisori window with a dismiss button at the bottom and keep on go . + ad a new prefer for control how mani statu messag are print dure updat detect : statusdepth control the maximum depth for path on the local machin ( longer path are not display , nor are non-directori path ) . the valu should be an integ ; default is number . + remov the trace and silent prefer . they did not seem veri use , and there were too mani prefer for control output in variou way . + the text ui now display just the default command ( the one that will be use if the user just type ) instead of all avail command . type ? will print the full list of possibl . + the function that find the canon hostnam of the local host ( which is use , for exampl , in calcul the name of the archiv file use to rememb which file have been synchron ) normal use the gethostnam oper system call . howev , if the environ variabl unisonlocalhostnam is set , it valu will now be use instead . thi make it easier to use unison in situat where a machin 's name chang frequent ( e.g. , becaus it is a laptop and get move around a lot ) . + file owner and group are now display in the `` detail window '' at the bottom of the screen , when unison is configur to synchron them . * for hacker : + updat to jacqu garrigu 's new version of lablgtk , which mean we can throw away our local patch version . if you 're compil the gtk version of unison from sourc , you 'll need to updat your copi of lablgtk to the develop releas , avail from httpaddr ( warn : instal lablgtk under window is current a bit challeng . ) + the todo.txt file ( in the sourc distribut ) ha been clean up and reorgan . the list of pend task should be much easier to make sens of , for peopl that may want to contribut their program energi . there is also a separ file bugs.txt for open bug . + the tk user interfac ha been remov ( it wa not be maintain and no longer compil ) . + the debug prefer now print quit a bit of addit inform that should be use for identifi sourc of problem . + the version number of the remot server is now check right away dure the connect setup handshak , rather than later . ( somebodi sent a bug report of a server crash that turn out to come from use inconsist version : better to check thi earlier and in a way that ca n't crash either client or server . ) + unison now run correctli on number-bit architectur ( e.g . alpha linux ) . we will not be distribut binari for these architectur ourselv ( at least for a while ) but if someon would like to make them avail , we 'll be glad to provid a link to them . * bug fix : + pattern match ( e.g . for ignor ) is now case-insensit when unison is in case-insensit mode ( i.e. , when one of the replica is on a window machin ) . + some peopl had troubl with mysteri failur dure propag of updat , where file would be fals report as have chang dure synchron . thi should be fix . + numer smaller fix . chang sinc number.number.numb : * ad a number of 'sort mode ' for the user interfac . by default , conflict chang are display at the top , and the rest of the entri are sort in alphabet order . thi behavior can be chang in the follow way : + set the sortnewfirst prefer to true caus newli creat file to be display befor chang file . + set sortbys caus file to be display in increas order of size . + give the prefer sortfirst= ( where is a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignor ' and 'follow' pattern , caus path match thi pattern to be display first . + similarli , give the prefer sortlast= caus path match thi pattern to be display last . the sort prefer are describ in more detail in the user manual . the sortnewfirst and sortbys flag can also be access from the 'sort ' menu in the grpahic user interfac . * ad two new prefer that can be use to chang unison' fundament behavior to make it more like a mirror tool instead of a synchron . + give the prefer prefer with argument ( by ad -prefer to the command line or prefer= ) to your profil ) mean that , if there is a conflict , the content of should be propag to the other replica ( with no question ask ) . non-conflict chang are treat as usual . + give the prefer forc with argument will make unison resolv all differ in favor of the given root , even if it wa the other replica that wa chang . these option should be use with care !
