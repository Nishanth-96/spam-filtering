while wander through uppsala , sweden last week , i ran across the '' keramik '' studio of paula von freymann . her potteri work ha the theme of '' fossil for the futur '' , and she ha two main line of thi work . one is more convent , take leav from plant at the nearbi linnea garden and impress them into the clay befor fire , leav a `` fossil '' of the plant . the other is more uniqu , take imprint of circuit board , cellular telephon , punch card , etc . and then fire the result to make `` it fossil . '' given how quickli most of our work becom obsolet , i found the offbeat notion of it fossil an oddli fit way of archiv the physic detritu of the digit age . httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr my guess is she 'd gladli make fossil of ani object you want , for a price . could be an interest memori of your next product launch ! - jim httpaddr
