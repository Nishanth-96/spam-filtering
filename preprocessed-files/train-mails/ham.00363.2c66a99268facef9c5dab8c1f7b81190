paul , my apolog for be irrit on the subject . i 'll tone down the rhetor . quot paul linehan emailaddr > inde - that i actual had understood prior to all thi - for > exampl commerci entiti with trial/limited/crippl edit . > > which is no problem - i do n't see whi that should be a problem for > suse though - sure the more the merrrier as far as they'r > concern . anyth either you or i have to say about their motiv is specul . bear that disclaim in mind , here 's mine : they make money from sell box set . they 're glad to make some version avail for almost-unrestrict distribut ( not `` for valu '' ) via cd duplic or the internet that they estim wo n't substitut for boxed-set sale . for exampl , they _could_ have packag what i call the `` ftp edit '' in isonumb imag . the fact that they did n't suggest to me that they see the inconveni of mirror ftp edit inumb file ( which , at the moment , are v. number.numb ) as motiv for all but the realli determin to buy box set , instead . likewis , they _could_ releas a v. number.numb ( current ) version of the '' evalu '' single-disk iso imag . instead , they alway keep it sever version behind . thi again seem like an incent to buy a box set , after `` evalu '' suse via the iso imag . again , the abov is my specul ( onli ) about their motiv . all we know of a certainti is what permiss they 've grant , which are a bit messi and complex , but nonetheless quit clear . those permiss , as a remind , appli to the suse-produc compon , yast , yastnumb , the distribut instal program , and possibl other util that i do n't know of . _they_ wrote that code , and have everi right to grant or withhold permiss as suit them best . > one can suspect what one like . what i did n't understand wa that suse > had proprietari extens that it wa n't prepar to allow peopl to > use under the gpl or even under a freebsd style licenc . hmm , let 's slow down , here : there 's a persist misconcept that it 's possibl to place somebodi els 's work under a new licenc without hi permiss . not so . there is noth in copyright law that would make that possibl . the copyright _owner_ ha inher right in hi ( e.g. , softwar ) work , and is entitl to issu as mani _instances_ of hi code under divers licenc as he wish . ( if he give you a copi with no licenc statement , there 's effect a default licenc by oper of copyright law . to avoid go into a long digress , let me just say that it 's a proprietari licenc by default . that 's whi , in order to have open sourc softwar at all , there must be an explicit licenc from the copyright holder . ) no linux distribut _ever_ entail relicens peopl 's softwar without their explicit permiss -- sinc no such relicens can occur at all . you can not get away with take suse linux ag 's work and redistribut it under what you claim to be a bsd licenc , or the gpl , or anyth at all other than what the copyright owner ha specifi , becaus you simpli lack the right to do so . claim to do it would be copyright violat . > i thought that the model for the like of suse wa sell support and > customis , rather than what i thought of as the core `` product '' . i > thought that the like of yast came under core - mayb it work in > the glori day befor , say , number - i can understand that they might > want to make more money , but the way in which they have done it , seem > to me , to be be against the spirit of the gpl . if stallman and friend at the gpl ( let alon linu torvald and kernel contributor ) had intend to prohibit put gpled work on the same cd as proprietari one , and sell the result onli via retail store ( plu mail order , etc . ) in shrink-wrap box , i 'm number % certain they could and would have done so . guess what ? they did not . they did n't even requir that anybodi give you copi of the gpled compon , ever , at all . all they did wa requir that _if_ you receiv gpled softwar law , then you had to be abl to get match sourc code for a limit period , upon request . spirit of the gpl , you say ? i 'd suggest that stallman and compani knew exactli what they were do , and that the degre of access to gpled softwar is exactli what they had in mind . > all i want is the os and gnu app . i wa under the impress that for > *_those_* all one need wa to pay for the media and not for the code > itself ? > > ai-j tort ? mai si . you are inde under a misconcept , and may want to read the text of the gpl to verifi thi fact . the gpl doe _not_ entitl you to a copi of ani binari softwar . section number provid for right to access to match sourc code _if_ you have law receiv a copi of a cover binari . that section provid three altern mechan for the distributor to provid such access . and suse _do_ actual provid exactli that access . or so i think to be the case . if you believ there 's some gpled codebas that you can law receiv from suse whose match sourc code they are not make avail exactli as requir , pleas tell us which codebas that is . ( that would be suse linux ag 's headach , not ani of our , but it might be interest to examin . ) > my understand wa that binari or whatev could be receiv for > the cost of the media plu a token of one 's appreci ( the latter > be subject to agreement between the parti ) - i wa offer a > bottl of wine plu mayb a pint or two and a chat for a copi - i > do n't know what the go rate is . your understand is almost correct , but not quit . ( number ) the access provis of the gpl concern access to _sourc code_ , not binari . ( number ) it kick in _only_ for peopl who 've law receiv cover binari . ( number ) _covered_ softwar mean instanc of codebas actual place under the gnu gpl by their copyright owner . the mere act of place a piec of softwar on a cd-rom with gpled softwar doe n't gpl it . in fact , the assert to the contrari is a favourit fud tactic from enemi of linux : they 're forev tri to convinc softwar produc that use gpled softwar in ani way with their proprietari offer will `` taint '' their copyright and forc them to put their properti under the gpl . it 's simpli not so . > if i want support from suse , that would be a differ issu , and > one for which i would be will to pay . that 's nice , but they 're not _offering_ the exact content of the box set free of charg and law to duplic & redistribut , or `` borrow '' . for one thing , as you will have notic from my earlier list of compon , the box set ' cd-rom includ quit a lot of _third-party_ proprietari softwar . suse linux ag _cannot_ allow you ( or your friend ) to hand out copi of that softwar freeli , becaus it 's not their in the first place . > i have a friend with number.numb - i think that i 'll end up do that ! if you mean the number-cd core set of rh number.numb , good . it 's a quit decent distribut . but bear in mind that the rh number.numb box set includ some other third-parti applic whose owner would be veri upset to find them be copi or `` borrow '' . > i have now realis thi , thank to your kind explan . i can > borrow them , but not copi them ? no . look , it 's a collect of softwar , mani element of which may not be law just given out to multipl peopl : your friend instal it , then _not_ eras it but mere let you `` borrow '' the cd result in the product be instal in multipl place . that 's unauthoris copi . > and , as i 've tri to explain , is not the licenc term on , say , > trial for commerci compani x to which i object , it is the way suse > appear , at least to my i.t . peasant self , to have mix up > proprietari and open stuff . well , if you do n't like suse , then you probabl wo n't like caldera edesk , xandro desktop , lycori deskop lx , libranet , lindow , or krud , either . depend on your criteria , you also might not like red hat , linux-mandrak , or yellow dog , sinc all of those have boxed-set retail set that includ cd-rom that may not be publicli redistribut .
