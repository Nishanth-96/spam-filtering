hiya folk , i 'm current run rawhid , sinc i had the brilliant idea that , by use apt , it might actual be practic to keep up with the develop . howev , apt seem to want a recompil - it sometim leav the rpm databas in need of a db_recov - and gcc number.numb seem to requir a closer adher to the standard than the c++ in apt wa written for . thi is a bit of a bummer . doe anyon know if there 's a latest version i could tri which might work , or whether i should simpli do the port myself ? ( i 've made a start , but there 's a fair amount of work to do . ) if thi work out , i might start a repositori for the freshrpm compil on vlatest rawhid , for my own purpos and anyon els who' interest . dave . _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list httpaddr
