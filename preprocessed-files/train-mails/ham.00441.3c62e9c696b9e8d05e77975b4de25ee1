hi all , i have an isa pnp card that will use io numberxnumb if avail . if locat at numberxnumb the card never work , at numberxnumb it alway doe . i suspect the problem is the soundcard ( creativ sb pci-numb ) gameport control , which also seem to live here . i 'm not use the control , so it doe n't show in /proc/ioport , so autodetect happili put my isa card there . i can get the card to work easili enough use isapnptool , ban the numberxnumb rang in /etc/isapnp.gon , and then use `` insmod radio-cadet io=numberxnumb '' , but i 'd like to get the autodetect work , so what i think i 'm look for is some way of ad `` do n't go here , do n't bother me '' entri into /proc/ioport . anybodi ? tia , ronan . -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
