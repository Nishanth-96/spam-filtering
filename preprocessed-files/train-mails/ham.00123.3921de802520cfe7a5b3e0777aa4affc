gcc , glibc and binutil , which the lf site say not to optimis , alreadi determin what system you 're compil on , and optimis itself to that . that 's my understand of how it work anyway . john subject : re : [ ilug ] optim for pentium pt.number on fri , jul number , number at number : number : numberpm +number , john gay wrote : > a while ago i ask what other packag i should optom for pentium . > one > person answer glibc . thi got me think about gcc itself , so i ask on > anoth list and got a few answer , most were `` do n't even think about it '' but > a few suggest gcc and one point me to linux from scratch . whi ? or more specif , what do you mean ? on one hand you can optimis how gcc is compil . all that will do is make it gener the exact same code just a smidg faster . and sinc gcc is such a memori pig , you 'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cach hit and to keep gcc 's heap out of swap . on the other side you can look into patch to gcc that affect it 's code gener . um , ok , but keep in mind that compil error suck . i can't express that enough . compil should just work . perfectli . alway . do anyth that might affect that is , in my opinion , insan . they'r hard to trace and you 'd better have a deep knowledg of what 's go on to either report bug to the patch develop or to fix it yourself . plu my understand is that gcc would need major chang to get larg speed boost on xnumber chip . kevin -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
