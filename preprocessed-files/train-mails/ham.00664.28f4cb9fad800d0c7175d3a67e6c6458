( ( ( oh yeah . you bet it doe . ) ) ) the number of night when temperatur stay abov number celsiu ( number fahrenheit ) in tokyo ha doubl over the last number year , while averag temperatur have shot up by number.numb degre c over the last centuri . relief , howev distant , could be on the way . ( ( ( `` great news , weather suffer ! we live in the high-tech capit of a g-number state ! '' ) ) ) `` at the behest of the construct ministri , the panel ha drawn up a plan that would use a network of buri pipe , and water pump from the sea , to cool thing down . 'in the veri best condit , certain area could in theori becom as much as number.numb degre celsiu cooler , ' said yujin minob , a ministri planner . `` the huge air-condit system current use to cool build get rid of the heat they take out of the structur by vent it into the outsid air , rais temperatur still further and creat a 'heat island ' phenomenon in larg citi . ( ( ( soon whole *cities* will do it and vent their heat straight into the rise sea ! look out , antarctica . ) ) ) `` under the plan , thi heat would be transfer to water in larg underground tank , and the water then pump through a six-km ( number.number-mil ) network of underground pipe to a cool plant on the tokyo waterfront . `` there the heat from thi water would be transfer to cooler sea water befor the then-cool water wa pump back through the underground pipe . the sea water , now warm , would be releas into the water of tokyo bay . `` costli plan .
