( thi sort of cleanup particularli hurt peopl like myself who have huge patch touch larg part of the tree ) . the recent gcc- > cnumber struct initialis patch for instanc made larg part of my tree reject . with more to come , the fun is n't over yet either . that is the cv version , but it seem that more breakag is to come with the kernel : ( ( everyon will want to compil their machin on the latest greatest ... i think they eventu persuad compaq 's compil to compil the kernel ) ... l. -- dbp dbbbbb | if you 're look at me to be an account dbp | then you will look but you will never see dbp dbbbk ' | if you 're look at me to start have babi dbp db ' db | then you can wish becaus i 'm not here to fool around dbbbbp dbbbbp ' | bell & sebastian ( famili tree ) -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
