dear c. greg curri , thi network world fusion articl wa sent to you by geeg guten tag , y'all . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- have you visit network world fusion yet ? on www.nwfusion.com you will find addit inform articl , primer and research on specif network technolog and product . visit us today at www.nwfusion.com -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- /news/number/numberspecialfocus.html : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- pnumberp get down to some seriou work by john fontana network world , number/number/numb just a few year remov from the mayhem of music swap that clog corpor network , peer-to-p technolog is grow up and rediscov it root as a legitim concept for distribut comput in corpor environ and the internet . the turnaround is distinct sinc pnumberp ha distanc itself from the darl day of napster and ha been transplant onto the architectur draw board of internet and corpor network guru . for network execut , the about-fac is show up in such discret place as wireless rout , ident manag , web servic and grid comput . pnumberp ha prove it worth - albeit with a few wart - in enterpris collabor and content manag applic , but it brightest futur may be in the plumb of corpor distribut comput . but even as pnumberp fade into the background , question around secur , standard and qualiti of servic still have to be answer befor pnumberp can flourish , expert say . the pnumberp evolut regardless , pnumberp 's evolut ha hit it next stage . `` peer-to-p is an architectur and one that will play a substanti role in distribut comput as endpoint in the network gain more power , '' say jami lewi , ceo and research chair of burton group . he say that will be particularli import for web servic as peer share process and data . `` pnumberp will becom a fundament part of how distribut comput evolv across the internet and how enterpris build distribut system intern . '' lewi say the internet today is veri rudimentari with it basic protocol for basic oper . `` now we 're serious talk about the network becom the comput , incorpor some pnumberp connect and be abl to share process and power , which is what grid comput provid . '' observ say it 's a renaiss . `` pnumberp 's revert to an architectur that can be appli to solv problem that by their veri natur are distribut , '' say neil macehit , senior consult for ovum , a research and consult firm . `` but the question is can thi model provid benefit for busi use . '' macehit say it can , but he caution that secur , such as remov block to pnumberp traffic on corpor firewal , is still a major inhibitor to accept . `` but you can imagin someth like grid extend to share applic logic instead of just be a data grid or a storag grid . when you look at web servic share busi logic in the enterpris , you see the intersect with grid and pnumberp , '' he say . work togeth to underscor pnumberp 's evolut , the global grid forum ( ggf ) , a number-year-old group found by academ and research , merg in april with the pnumberp work group , origin found by intel . the group are attempt to marri the ggf 's work on har server on a grid with pnumberp 's abil to connect desktop . `` we 're now tri to figur out how grid and pnumberp play nice togeth , and captur that power for use in enterpris comput , '' say andrew chien , co-director of the ggf 's peer-to-p area and cto of entropia , a provid of desktop grid applic . late last month , the merg group began evalu how pnumberp relat to the open grid servic architectur , an effort to standard grid comput . chien say hi group is explor how pnumberp protocol for such thing as registr , resourc discoveri and coordin of data transfer support a common grid infrastructur . and pnumberp 's root are reach into other area . it is an integr part of mobil wireless technolog set for releas thi fall by meshnetwork . the compani 's meshlan softwar extend the rang of number.numb wireless network by make everi wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc pnumberp network and also a router/repeat to channel traffic to other peer . use a patent multihop technolog , peer that are out of rang of wireless access point or peer they wish to commun with can hop through other peer to reach their destin , includ corpor lan . it not onli increas the wireless rang , it preserv throughput , which is up to number megabit . the technolog also is mobil , let hop take place from node travel in vehicl up to number mph . `` pnumberp allow us to do the hop , and our algorithm allow the traffic to pick the most effici path to travel , '' say rick rotondo , vice presid of disrupt technolog for meshnetwork . `` the beauti of a pnumberp network is that it is self-form and self-heal . '' and the technolog is matur . the defens advanc research project agenc ( darpa ) , which creat the internet , spent dollarnumb million develop the peer technolog for use in form instant network among soldier on a battlefield . meshnetwork licens it from darpa ha spent an addit dollarnumb million to creat a commerci product . pnumberp also is key to the pingid project to creat an ident manag system similar to work under way by microsoft and the liberti allianc project , which are not use pnumberp . `` ideal , you need a way to creat , manag and exchang digit ident inform with no one in the middl of the transact , '' say andr duran , founder of the project . he say that 's pnumberp , but it 's just one part of the equat . `` your id is a virtual privat vault with differ drawer , '' duran say . `` one drawer may be on your pc , one may be with a servic provid , and you need a client to manag all that . we are build the infrastructur to support that . '' ping id is work on server and client softwar that act like a mini-web server and maintain a repositori of user 's ident inform . user have the option of exchang id directli through pnumberp or use client/serv technolog to author a third parti to dispens their ident data . `` pnumberp provid a level of control that other architectur do n't , '' duran say . `` it come down to the fact that some applic are more effici with pnumberp . '' that is the concept that is drive pnumberp into so mani differ area of comput . `` pnumberp ha evolv from someth highli disrupt to someth complementari to intranet , extranet , mobil user and all the web integr , '' say greg bolcer , cto of endeavor technolog , which develop a pnumberp collabor softwar call magi . and although pnumberp is still settl into thi new role , it 's obviou that it reput as a music-swap corpor scourg are now well behind it . copyright number network world , inc. all right reserv -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- sent by : geeg emailaddr ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . thi messag wa sent from /news/number/numberspecialfocus.html on network world fusion httpaddr ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . httpaddr
