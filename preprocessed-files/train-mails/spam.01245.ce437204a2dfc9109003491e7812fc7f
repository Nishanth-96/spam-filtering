( number % of the worldwid gross nation product of more than number billion us dollar = more than number usdollar per year= more than number billion usdollar per day ) theadvantag of the technolog develop by us : a. the introduct of such technolog will dramat reduc the expens of auto-insur . thi reduct of insur cost will be at par with or even more that the expens incur toward the introduct of such technolog in modern day vehicl . accordingli , the life insur premier will also undergo drastic reduct . addit , becaus of save of live , the outgo of the insur compani will reduc substanti . b.a per the who studi and project , road accid occupi the number nine posit by way of caus of death in the world today . it is project by who that by the year number they will occupi the number three posit , next onli to heart diseas and depress . by introduct of thi technolog , we are sure that thi will not happen . on the contrari there will be massiv reduct in the number of death due to road accid and road accid may not figur on the list of major caus of death , in the year number at all . c. thi technolog will therefor , make all vehicl cheaper and safer . not onli will the cost be reduc , safeti which is priceless in itself , will also be greatli enhanc . as and when the regular patent applic is file and patent is grant , the life of the patent will be number year . even at the current level , with road accid place at number nine on the who list as a major caus of death , there is a daili loss of two billion usdollar . even at the present level , over a period of twenti year , without ani interest and without ani compound , thi loss work out to be : number billion usdollar x number day x number year - number , number billion usdollar . d. our technolog will ensur that at least seventy-f percent of the abov loss are prevent . such figur work out to be more that number , number billion usdollar . it is import to note that thi is the project at the current level . as per the futur project , the incid of road accid are expect to increas . henc , the figur is like to be increas veri substanti . in addit the time factor and the interest factor will inflat thi figur further . e. at the current level , more than number.numb million person are die everi year due to road accid . even at the current rate , more than number million live will be lost in road accid over the next twenti year ( i.e . life of the patent , when grant ) . besid , at the current level . number.numb million peopl are injur everi year . in the next twenti year , the number of peopl injur due to road accid , will therefor be more than half a billion . f. if we add to that the person , physic and psycholog trauma to those directli involv in and also to those who are associ with the peopl involv in the road accid . the trauma and the miseri and henceforth the valu of the save , are all unmeasur in quantiti , present known to human kind . g. consid the figur and dynam as explain hereinabov , it may not be improp or out of place to compar thi technolog with the introduct of electr , comput or aircraft in term of it valu to mankind . h. the benefit of thi technolog will be so obviou and essenti that , in the veri near futur , the use of thi technolog will becom unavoid . it should and will becom mandatori by law , to instal such technolog and the instal of such technolog should and will be a pre-requisit for grant or renew of the registr and licens of all vehicl in futur . i. as describ hereinabov ; thi technolog and it util are incompar , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgat in human travel and safeti measur . in futur , it can and will be appli to other mode of transport , like aircraft and train also . . among other thing , we have the follow option avail to us : -option avail to us : - a- outright sale ( a ) immedi outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our file applic for one time lump sum consider . ( b ) further develop of the concept and further file of patent and all patent relat applic , befor take step as outlin in `` a '' . the process ( b ) will obvious increas the realiz in term of price . b- licenc option i ) new vehicles- grant of licens to manufactur of automobil , individu or collect , all over the world for incorpor in the automobil to be manufactur in futur on fix time or per piec basi . ii ) convers of exist vehicl - to independ agent for convers of the exist more than number billion vehicl all over the world . c - combin option a collabor arrang with some privat and/or govern agenc wherein we receiv a certain down payment and then jointli distribut the licens right on a pre-decid share ( partnership ) arrang . the econom of the project will be as follow : - number ) in case any/al process and system describ by us are incorpor in the design of new vehicl and the new vehicl are manufactur in accord with the modifi design , the cost escal may not be more than number % to number % , and the safeti and the protect will be ten time ( more than ) the price escal . henc , drop in insur premier will compens for the cost escal . number ) in case , the exist vehicl are modifi , the cost involv will be approxim number % to number % of the valu of the vehicl . but partial modif at a lower cost , which will give partial protect , may also be carri out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modif in percentag term will be about one fifth of the percentag of safeti and protect provid . number ) in case the valu of the vehicl is low or the life of the vehicl is about to expir , the partial modif may be practic and econom viabl , as incorpor onto a new vehicl is rel less expens and more protect . number ) there are more than number billion motor vehicl in the world at present . besid there are an unspecifi number of non-motor ehicl . number ) almost all of them can be convert in phase manner to a variabl degre . the cost of convers will be directli proport to their current market valu and the safeti shield to be gener there from . number ) among the motoris vehicl , the convers cost may work out of few dollar for everi percent of safeti shield creat the exact calcul can be work out , but over all , some of the method may provid more safeti at lower cost compar to the other which may differ in effici . number ) even if we consid a veri vagu and approxim cost of convers of number usdollar per vehicl , the convers industri work out to be worth number , number , number billion usdollar . number ) realis the potenti of the product in term of human safeti , it will be reason to presum that major of such convers will be complet over a period of three year from the start date . number ) as point hereinabov , the size of the convers industri may be estim to , in the rang of number , number , number billion usdollar per year over the next three year . number ) altern , consid the divers of avail motoris vehicl all over the world , convers licens can also be commerci viabl proposit . for such convers , licens can be grant on-lin , on receipt of on-lin payment . in that case , differ rate for grant convers to vehicl have specif registr number can be grant in accord with and in proport to the size , carri capac and the engin power of the vehicl . number ) in case , licens is done , the creation and instal of the concern system will be done by the end-us , as per hi circumst and need . howev , piraci is like to be a major problem in such licens . number ) it is like that as and when the system are introduc in the motoris vehicl , unusu and unpreced demand of new vehicl is creat . thi will result in massiv reject of the vehicl current play all over the world and stimul an entir new market as far as motoris vehicl is concern . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and/or estim . p. . number ) some of the figur have been round off but gener the figur are correct . number ) we have tri to keep thi commun brief and to the point . more detail , includ websit refer are avail with us and can be provid , if requir . -- -- -- =_nextpart_aaxpmnbmet -- httpaddr
