the riaa continu to amaz me . everyon might want to grok the news yahoo ha : httpaddr and if you 're realli bore , go ahead and read the paper that were file by the riaa against the major backbon provid . httpaddr so it look like the riaa is get bore with it usual tack of su the peer-to-p servic , and is instead use the dmca to sue isp and backbon into complianc -- they want said backbon to block the ip address of the listennumberever.com server due to listennumberev 's alleg infring of copyright . to quot the motion that the riaa issu : `` plaintiff request that the court issu a preliminari injunct requir defend to block commun to and from listennumberev 's server that travel through defend ' backbon rout system '' . at least accord to the riaa ( probabl for bonu terror tactic ) the listennumberev site is even more formid than that bane of pnumberp good , napster , due to the fact that it on a central server , out of their reach of riaa/dmca control ( it locat in china ) , and becaus accord to the riaa it facilit the download of entir album . appar listennumberev ha a few other site float around , and the riaa ha been unsuccess in get ani of them to voluntarili surrend servic ( number ) . got ta love the riaa for jump into thi lawsuit with the customer' interest in mind . how lawyer can write drivel along the line of 'if you dont stop these guy , we 'll run out of money and we wo n't be abl to suppli you new music ! ' just blow my mind , especi in thi day and age . the riaa ha enough money to file inan lawsuit against backbon provid , but they do n't have enough money to produc new artist ? someth seem wrong here . here 's my problem . say the riaa win in court , and the backbon provid compli . their biggest hurdl is now accomplish , and one hell of a terribl precid is/can be set . at least in the riaa' case , i 'm sure onc they get a court-mand ok for thi particular site , they 'll just go ahead , write their nice friendli lawyer letter , and demand that subsequ ip address also be block , as they too rout to site that are problemat to the riaa . even wors , the concept that other group ( the first that flash into my littl brain be the scientologist ) also decid that thi is the way to go . if the riaa prevail , they have record set , albiet in ny onli , that can be point back to , and use in other case . eventu thi will hit a larg enough court that precid will set , and we have a veri quiet , veri non-report event occur from then on , the systemat c & ding of the internet . anyth that violat the dmca , given it takedown provis , might now potenti fall prey to a ceas & desist letter . rather than appeal , the backbon provid will just agre -- as they seem like to do 'provid a court order ' . point be is that soon thi wo n't take a court order . a nastygram will suffic and we 'll wonder where all the new music/information/diss opinions/ critic went . thi is a scari road we 're run down here . so nice to see that it still hush-hush in the geek commun . what more bizzar is some of the support ( ? ) that the riaa seem to get . i 'm curiou for instanc , how dave farber got drag into thi ...
