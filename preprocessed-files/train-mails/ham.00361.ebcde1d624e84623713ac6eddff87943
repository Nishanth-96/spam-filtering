( and , with a good enough sale pitch , you just might get away with it ! ) howev , what the gpl doe stipul is that you must provid the sourc for that binari if ask . so i might buy it from you for eur number , compil it myself and sell that binari for eur number . of cours , i 'll need to provid the sourc to anyon that ask as well . but , i just might make money at thi , sinc there might be a market of number peopl who would pay number euro for the conveni of get a binari . but then , john looney would step in , buy it from me for number euro , burn it and the sourc and some of hi favourit /bin/tru patch on a cd and duplic it for the cost of the media or a cream bun , depend on how hungri he is . you see , the gpl doe n't forc the binari to be zero-cost ( or cost-of-media ) , but it put a realli big hole in ani busi plan that sole resel gpl softwar . you _can_ charg for it if you want , but you bloodi well better be provid some valu for that money , or you 'll go out of busi faster than a dot-com in number . and there are real way to provid thi valu for money ( conveni of get it on one cd , conveni of a friendli instal , conveni of vendor-suppli updat , conveni of have what lot of other peopl have , post a cd and pay a few euro is cheaper than download over a modem , warm fuzzi feel of get someth from a `` real '' compani , etc ) . there will be segment of the market that will pay variou amount for gpl softwar and there will be other that do n't . thank , the gpl allow for both , _by_design_ . but the sourc will alway be free ( or minim cost ) . later , kenn -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
