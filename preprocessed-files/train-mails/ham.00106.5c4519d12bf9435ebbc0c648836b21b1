| date : sat , number jul number number : number : number +number | from : stephen shirley | [ ... ] | it 's veri easi to get one program to act on the output of a second | program : cmdnumber | cmdnumber . but , what if you want cmdnumber to act on the output | of cmdnumber as well ? hmm . eventu , i came up with thi solut : | | mkfifo io | cmdnumber io | | and bingo , all wa well with the world . now , i have ( and had ) a sneak | suspcion that it might be possibl to do thi without use a fifo , and | can be done use someth like : | number| exec number > & number number| cmdnumber & number number| exec number > & - | | but that doe n't work in that form , and i could n't work out an | incant that would . anyon got ani suggest ? [ ... ] the abov , or someth close to it , would work if , when the numberst line is execut , file descriptor ( fdesc ) number is open for both read and write ( r/w ) to a suitabl entiti ( e.g. , a pipe/fifo ; i imagin a socket or someth of that ilk could be made to work but have no idea whi you 'd want to go to the troubl ... . ) . but in ani case , all that is unlik to be the case : · most probabl , fdesc number is yer tti ( e.g . screen + keyboard ) ; and · quit possibl is open onli for write ( be stdout ) . you need it open for r/w becaus all dupnumb ( number ) -- - which is all `n > & m ' mean -- doe is replic the fdesc handl . it doe not chang the access mode ; e.g. , if the origin fdesc ( m ) wa onli open for write ( w ) , that 's all the new fdesc ( n ) is open for . yet in the numbernd line , it 's need for both r ( cmdnumber ) and w ( cmdnumber ) . whilst it 's imposs to say for certain from thi excerpt , it seem a reason guess that fdesc number when the numberst line execut is the stdout of the script itself , which is most probabl yer tti . that mean , if it doe happen to be open for r/w ( which is the case on some system ) , `cmdnumber ' would be write to the screen whilst `cmdnumber ' is read from the keyboard -- - i.e. , the poor confus human luser is `` clearli '' expect to manual echo back to the comput what it print . good luck ! ; - ) upshot : the fifo is need . and thi is n't a shell script problem per se . the fifo solut is fine . i 've use variat ( plural ) on thi approach to extend the korn ( ksh ( number ) ) shell languag , by provid a co-process interpret -- - `ksh ' send certain predefin command to the co-process , handl control over to the co-process until it indic process is complet and `ksh ' can resum normal process . with some thought and care to insur signal do someth ration , work great for ad a script languag ( which is the purpos ) cheapli to script-less program ( use when you ca n't modifi the , imho , buggi program to use , e.g. , tcl ) . cheer ! -blf- -- innov , veri experienc , unix and | brian foster dublin , ireland choru ( embed rto ) kernel intern | e-mail : emailaddr expert look for a new posit ... | mobil : ( +number or number ) number number number for a résumé , contact me , or see my websit httpaddr stop edollaro ( exxonmobil ) : « whatev you do , do n't buy esso -- - they do n't give a damn about global warming. » httpaddr support by greenpeac , friend of the earth , and numer other ... -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
