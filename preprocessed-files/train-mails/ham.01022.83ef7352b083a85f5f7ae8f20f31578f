'' the difficulti is similar to the one pose by the year number comput problem , when comput softwar had to be switch from two-digit entri identifi year to four-digit entri . befor jan. number , number , million of line of code had to be rewritten to avoid widespread comput failur . bar code have been use in packag sinc number , when the first item , a pack of chew gum , wa scan at a supermarket in ohio . the code identifi a product , distinguish between an eight-ounc can of del mont cream corn and a medium-s pair of hane boxer short . when a bar code is scan , the inform in the store' databas let the retail assign a price and track sale and inventori . `` the bar code is the linchpin upon which everyth in retail depend , '' mr. friedman said . the reason for expand the number-digit bar code , known as the univers product code , is twofold . first , there is a shortag of u.p.c . number . `` there 's onli a certain amount of number-digit number , and we 're go to run out , '' said john terwillig , vice presid of global market at the univers code council , a nonprofit organ base in lawrencevil , n.j. , that assign code in the unit state and canada . second , number-digit bar code are use almost everywher els in the world . the council 's european counterpart , ean intern , base in brussel , assign these number , call european articl number , to compani in number nation . `` right now , '' mr. terwillig said , '' foreign import have to get a number-digit u.p.c . to do busi over here , which they have n't been too happi about . '' foreign manufactur current pass on to consum the cost of get an addit bar code and creat special label for product sold in the unit state and canada . `` it 's an ad expens for them , and they have to recoup it somewher , '' said debra shimku , market manag at the chicago import compani , a specialti food import whose oversea supplier are often incredul when they are told they have to get new bar code for their product befor they can be sold in american groceri . mani foreign manufactur decid that it is not worth the troubl . `` a lot of compani have been unwil to accept the addit burden , '' mr. terwillig said , `` and have stay out of the market entir . '' american and canadian export have not had the same obstacl becaus foreign retail can easili incorpor a number-digit number into their number-digit databas by make the first digit zero . that is whi american and canadian manufactur of product that now have number-digit code will not be affect by the code expans . a two-lit bottl of coca-cola , for exampl , will keep the same u.p.c. , but a zero will be ad to the begin of it bar-cod number in retail ' product databas . `` the effect of the chang in the u.p.c . code fall squar on retail , '' said mr. friedman . he estim that the upgrad will cost at least dollarnumb million for a chain of number store with number checkout lane a store . the expens will vari depend on the age of a retailer' databas , softwar and hardwar and whether it ha to hire outsid consult to make the chang . scanner and other hardwar bought more than three year ago will not read longer code and will have to be replac . softwar more than five year old will also have to be scrap . `` thank god we 'd alreadi plan to buy new equip for a lot of store thi year , '' said richard s. gilbert , director of store system at duan read , a chain of number drugstor in new york citi . the store have a total of number , number scan devic , each cost dollarnumb , number to dollarnumb , number . as for the cumbersom databas modif that need to be made , mr. gilbert said : `` our consult say they are work on it , but they have n't gotten back to me with a plan . i still do n't know how big a deal it 's all go to be . '' he might want to ask john poss . mr. poss is the merchandis coordin for ace hardwar , which ha number , number store and sell some number , number code product . ace overhaul it comput system to accept longer bar code in number . the compani , base in oak brook , ill. , ha retail outlet in number countri and more than a hundr foreign supplier . `` it wa such a struggl to get manufactur to relabel thing for north america , '' mr. poss said , `` and we want the same system in place global , so we decid to make the chang . '' the compani hire a consult , cogniz technolog solut , which is base in teaneck , n.j. , and is a divis of dun & bradstreet . ace 's in-hous team work on the project dure the day while a cogniz offic in india took over at night . even so , the project took almost two year to plan and carri out . in addit to equip upgrad , modif had to be made in more than number softwar program in variou compani divis ( number in distribut alon ) . the most tediou and time-consum part of the convers , mr. poss said , wa make adjust to databas . `` everi databas in everi divis touch bar code inform , and they all need to be rework , '' he said . `` it 's like ynumberk , where you had to go in and expand field and find everi refer to the date . '' though mr. poss would not disclos the cost of the project , he said the gain in effici and in supplier ' good will had been `` well worth the expens . '' hi advic to other retail is to `` get busi becaus you 're face an extrem challeng . '' but move to number digit may not be enough . the univers code council and ean intern , which form an allianc in number , strongli advis manufactur and retail to go a step further and prepar their system to accommod a number-digit code . that is the length of a newli patent bar code that take up less space . it reduc size mean that it can be affix to small item like loos produc , and the extra digit let a retail keep track of addit data like batch and lot number . that addit inform would make product recal easier . `` today , '' mr. terwillig said , `` onc a product is taken out of the ship contain in the warehous , you realli ca n't track it anymor . '' ship contain bar code are alreadi number digit . the differ bar-cod standard mean that retail need differ comput system for ship and receiv , inventori and sale . by adopt a number-digit standard , retail should be abl to put all the inform into a singl databas . mr. poss said ace had ad the capac to scan and store number digit when it made it convers three year ago . `` now we can scan anyth , '' he said , `` whether it 's in the warehous or at the regist , and it immedi goe in to a central system . no more send data between divis . '' the cost and work of make the transit to number digit , he said , wa the same as it would have been for a chang to number digit . repres from the standard group said adopt a number-digit structur - a step for which no date ha been set - could help streamlin the share of data among all part of a retail oper . it would also make it possibl , they said , to identifi product anywher in the world at ani time dure the trade process . `` and to think it all start with pack of gum , '' mr. poss said . httpaddr how to advertis -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - for inform on advertis in e-mail newslett or other creativ advertis opportun with the new york time on the web , pleas contact emailaddr or visit our onlin media kit at httpaddr for gener inform about nytimes.com , write to emailaddr copyright number the new york time compani httpaddr
