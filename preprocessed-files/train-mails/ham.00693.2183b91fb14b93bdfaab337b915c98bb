rohit wa wonder what microsoft 's definit of a chief softwar architect is ( and , consequ , what microsoft think is a roadmap ) . here you go , from mr. ballmer to mr. gillmor to mr. fork ... architectur is war ; love 'em or hate 'em , at least microsoft understand that : as chief sa , billg overse all product strategi . `` there are two thing a road map can be . one is just a piec of paper that tell what everyon is do and record a bunch of bottom-up plan . or it can be someth where we impos more broadli our vision from the top . we are not go to tri to get everyth share . ... that 's a path for get everyth stop up . but at the same time we are tri to take the top four or five thing we are tri to do in the longhorn wave , yukon wave , or the .net wave and realli have enough time to have some cross-cut discuss about how we make that happen . '' `` bill [ gate ] is dedic full-tim to be chief softwar architect . he also happen to be chairman of the compani , but he spend most of hi time be chief softwar architect . we have a bodi now that meet everi month -- the sltt [ senior leadership technic team ] , basic the top peopl involv in the product-cr strategi -- and we present and discuss the issu . bill is drive a process for each of these wave . for instanc , [ he will ask ] what are the cross-cut scenario that i want , and then [ he will ] get all the right product group togeth and bring these thing in front of the sltt .

'' httpaddr ballmer in charg juli number , number number : number pm pt no one know better than microsoft ceo steve ballmer that , as the .net platform evolv , the success of microsoft depend on how well the compani coordin it tool , server , and client strategi and how well it commun that vision . in an interview with infoworld test center director steve gillmor and infoworld editor at larg ed scannel at microsoft fusion number , ballmer discuss the progress of .net , chang in the compani 's approach to product develop , and microsoft' effort to simplifi product licens and inspir trust in custom and partner . > last time we talk wa two year ago , at the begin of the .net > era . so where are we now in the .net evolut ? let me start by talk about where i think we are in the xml revolut first , and then [ i will ] talk about where we are with .net . i believ that the it industri collect decid over the last three or four year that the world wa go to be replatform with xml as the key foundat . it 's not like anyon ever got togeth to decid thi , but it 's like magnet north , where it 's been clearli indic that everyon is ralli around the concept . but i think the degre to which [ xml ] is pervas might still be underestim . a lot of partner , even at thi confer , see it as b-to-b for big compani . but it is realli about the way softwar in gener is design . it is all about the way secur should work . manag -- everyth is chang . so to answer your direct question , two year ago i might have said the juri is still out about whether [ xml ] wa go to happen . we were question if it wa go to be a legitim competitor to java . but now the world ha decid to embrac [ xml ] as the basi for the next gener of technolog . and there are a lot of benefit that come with it . could it have been someth other than xml ? sure it could have . it wa n't the specif technic implement ; it is mere the fact that it come out of internet standard . it ha deeper semant abil . it is all about interoper and connect . so in that context , where are we with .net ? i 'll say a coupl thing . no . number , i would say we have some momentum in the market . we have custom use the .net product line , like merril [ lynch ] , credit suiss , mark & spencer , citibank , and a varieti of other . peopl who are do some thing for real . i feel like the degre we are out front is in some way smaller and in some way larger . > how so ? smaller in the sens that everyon is talk the xml talk , even sun ; bigger in the execut sens : we 've deliv . we deliv the first batch of product that realli were built xml to the core -- visual studio .net and biztalk server -- and we are get traction . so i feel good about where our execut is rel to everyon els . that is not to say that other peopl are n't do some reason bolt-on xml support for the stuff they have . > you have some heavi lift to do to convinc your custom and > partner to follow along . what do you have to do to set the standard > for adopt and upgrad to thi next gener ? we have to present the pictur that we are behav consist within the framework of focus on custom issu and custom satisfact and trustworthi comput , which we have articul . now there are some thing i would have done differ , in number-numb hindsight . i would have increas the focu on not just secur but deploy , becaus a lot of the secur problem are actual deploy problem . we have the fix , but sometim we ca n't get the tool in their hand to deploy those fix fast enough . licens -- i know i would have given more time , and there are better way to plan around the kind of chang we made . we are still go to have to get smart about the full ramif . > do you expect ani chang to be made between now and juli number to > licens number.numb ? there is a lot of push-back on thi . no , there is noth that will happen between now and juli number . and we will continu to learn over time what we need to do to earn our custom ' trust and earn their busi . i think mani of the peopl who are push back realli do n't even know the new term . > is n't that your fault for not educ them ? ye , it is our fault . but you meet with plenti of custom whose compani alreadi have licens , and they are say , 'i think there 's a problem . ' i do n't deni there are some problem . i am sure there are some issu we will have to work on over time . after juli number we are go to see what the real issu are . i wa talk to a custom at the show who wa say he thought there would be a problem , and i told him that we just complet a deal with hi compani and that he is now univers licens and that total cost to hi compani are now lower than they were befor . and he said , 'oh realli ? ' so we 'll go through juli number . we have a lot of custom who have sign licens , and i am sure we are go to find some issu . my bigger concern today are probabl not in the larger account , but there may be some issu we need to address among the smaller-s compani , and we will . > how doe the .net initi chang the way in-hous client and server > develop work togeth ? what we are tri to do for the health of .net and the health of the compani and the saniti of the peopl who work there and the qualiti of the product we produc is to have a more orchestr , ber-road map of where we are go . now there are two thing a road map can be . one is just a piec of paper that tell what everyon is do and record a bunch of bottom-up plan . or it can be someth where we impos more broadli our vision from the top . we are not go to tri to get everyth share . ... that 's a path for get everyth stop up . but at the same time we are tri to take the top four or five thing we are tri to do in the longhorn wave , yukon wave , or the .net wave and realli have enough time to have some cross-cut discuss about how we make that happen . bill [ gate ] is dedic full-tim to be chief softwar architect . he also happen to be chairman of the compani , but he spend most of hi time be chief softwar architect . we have a bodi now that meet everi month -- the sltt [ senior leadership technic team ] , basic the top peopl involv in the product-cr strategi -- and we present and discuss the issu . bill is drive a process for each of these wave . for instanc , [ he will ask ] what are the cross-cut scenario that i want , and then [ he will ] get all the right product group togeth and bring these thing in front of the sltt . peopl talk about what it take to be a good manag , and peopl talk about be a good coach and get peopl to like you . in a larg organ those thing are import , but at a certain level , ... the most import thing you can do for your peopl to make them better is to give them a framework where they can work in harmoni with the other peopl in the compani . and from bill 's perspect , [ thi framework ] is the technic road map and the sltt process ; it is the scenario . from my perspect , it is the p & l [ profit and loss ] structur and the multipl busi becaus , given how we work , give peopl a framework that get them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the part will mean we have better offer . > it seem the scenario construct is realli work for you . is thi an > evolut of the solut approach ? i would say it is a pretti direct extrapol from the solut stuff , onli i think we are just get a littl more experi . i think we use the word scenario more often and solut less , becaus solut sound more like a fix thing . at the end of the day , most of the thing we do are customiz and programm , and so peopl make them into the solut they want . but they are still scenario . what will softwar deploy look like ? well , that is a scenario becaus it involv window , offic , and other applic . we are work hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the part . that 's not to say peopl are alway comfort with thi . i ca n't even say we will do it perfectli . all we have to do is do it a lot better than we had been do it . i think that would be a big step forward for the custom . > will thi approach cut down on some of the technolog civil war > microsoft ha had in the past involv who is go to gain control of > a project ? thi seem to be a veri democrat approach to develop . i would not use the word democraci to describ it . peopl have to come togeth and ultim make some decis . thi is not a vote process here , the agenda of what we think is import . we get a lot of input . [ but ] onc it is decid , peopl do n't get to vote with their feet . we tri to make a quantum leap here in term of our abil to improv pull togeth all the piec . our custom want us to do that . simplifi concept by unifi them . the custom do n't say they want us to do that , but when we do do that , they go , 'ahhh , i get it . that make sens . ' i do n't want to go to six more meet where peopl say , 'i your workflow strategi biztalk ? ' ... or 'what 's your offic workflow strategi ? ' or 'whi is synchron in some way better for e-mail and outlook than it is for file folder and web page ? ' to get that sort of synchron sometim -- to get that high-level road map to work -- you have to build someth we do n't have today . so we have been talk about unifi storag . and so the best way to get all thi stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way . then you just keep tune one set of paramet instead of have a thousand flower bloom . > in your fusion keynot today , you talk about who your competitor > are , and it wa the usual suspect . but one you did n't mention is > yourself . you are compet against the last gener of your technolog . alway . given that our stuff doe n't wear out or break down -- you can question whether it break or not [ ballmer grin ] -- but it doesn't break down like machineri doe . to get anyon to do someth new , we have to have someth interest and innov . peopl think , ok , should we just do more upgrad or tri to sell more new product ? we decid that user like us to do a level of system integr so they do n't have to get involv in that . so take sharepoint team servic , which we put in offic . we could have sold team servic as a separ product , and we could have introduc a new sku [ stock keep unit ] . we could have decid if it should work down level with the old offic or just the new version of offic , and we could do that with real-tim commun . but we tend to like to put thing togeth , integr them , and then releas batch ? number ? -- which are then 'upgrad ' -- as a form of introduc our new innov . but no matter how you do it , becaus our stuff doe not wear out , we have to convinc peopl that some idea we have is better or more power than the older idea we had . and there are two aspect of do that . one aspect is , on a given product or upgrad releas , doe that make sens ? or do we convinc you that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innov that you will want to be licens for that innov . and thi is part of thi whole licens discuss we are have . we move to the new licens for two reason , i would say . no . number , we want to simplifi our licens . when we look back a year from now , i guarante you that where we are now is simpler than where we were . noth is simpler dure a transit becaus they are learn the new and are more familiar with the old , but i think peopl will eventu realiz thi is simpler . our licens got pretti complic over the year , and some peopl came to not understand it all . the other issu is [ the time of deliv ] our innov . i don't want to have a lot of rough question [ from custom ] . so when we do have new idea , it 's like , ok , should we put it in thi upgrad or that one or just have a stream of stuff that onli our best custom have access to under the term of their contract ? i think in the long run we have a better chanc of satisfi them with the latter than with hit them with six differ upgrad . i am a fan of [ let ] the custom decid , ok , i want that piec or thi piec . but they are licens for all of it . so those are the two thing we sought to do . > that get back to the trust issu , where if you front-load it , that' > the big , lumpi upgrad ; and if you back-load it with the vision , the > .net number server , you have a long gap in the middl where you have to > sell into an untrust audienc . the truth is , we need to be better at both . there are some thing you can onli do big and lumpi , like a new file system . it 's not like some sort of small user featur ; if you chang the file system , then the storag , the backup , probabi those thing are go to chang . probabl the shell ought to change.th applic ... a lot of thing are go to chang . can you call that lumpi ? or you can put out four new featur in powerpoint , sure -- that would not look lumpi to user . i think we have to build trust in the model , and we are go to have to deliv more over time . it will not come overnight . peopl will have to see that we do a few thing , ... that not all of our innov is lumpi , that more of it come evenli and steadili . peopl develop a confid and faith ; they like both aspect of the model . over time , our support need to becom more intim involv in that stori . we know that , but we do n't know exactli what that mean yet . and thi whole notion of softwar as a servic -- thi is not a licens or busi discuss . it 's how doe softwar get rearchitect in the world of the internet ? i mean , how mani softwar product are fundament differ becaus of the internet ? not mani . probabl the anti-viru guy keep up the best . they are alway feed new viru support in . i ask the audienc [ at fusion ] how mani use window updat . now that 's a small piec of softwar , but it is big . that 's the consum market ; we 've got to get that to realli purr in the corpor market . > the lack of broadband build-out and adopt seem to be hold up > the abil for user to take advantag of some new servic you'r > talk about . when bill [ gate ] invest in comcast cabl , it > trigger the babi bell to get on board with dsl . what are you do > now to deal with that issu ? the no . number thing is , we have to make softwar that is so compel that peopl will start say , 'well , of cours i am go to get broadband . ' > and number.numb is one of those compel featur ? ye , it is . i wa in a hotel in sun valley , [ utah ] , thi week that wa not wire . so i turn on my pc , and xp tell me there is a wireless network avail . so i connect to someth call mountain . well , i do n't know what that is . but i have a vpn into microsoft ; it work . i do n't know whose broadband i use . i did n't see it in bill 's room . i call him up and said , 'hey , come over to my room . ' so soon everyon is there and connect to the internet through my room . we have to support all the modal , whether it is gpr [ gener packet radio servic ] or number.numb . we have to make it easi to provis from a softwar perspect for thing that go on with dsl [ and ] cabl modem . ... and the softwar ha to want a broadband link . there are not mani thing you do where you say i realli care about the perform . if i am download powerpoint file , then i want broadband . so when you can do thing with speed that you otherwis ca n't do without speed , that is go to put a lot of pressur on the broadband commun . that 's the weird answer . the more normal answer is , yeah , is n't it aw : there is not enough broadband , and the price they charg ... . i agre with all that . if you look at what happen in japan recent , there wa a big drop -- it is now dollarnumb a month for dsl . vroom . they have gone from almost no dsl connect a year ago to number.numb [ million ] or number.numb million [ subscrib ] . > so how do we make that happen in thi countri ? i think that is beyond us . if there is enough interest where the consum are look intens for broadband , whether it is at today' price or tomorrow 's price , that is go to shake out the marketplac . and i think the marketplac will do a good job . we just have to make it someth obviou that consum want . now i happen to live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network . no dsl or cabl modem . well , i have a neighbor , [ teledes chairman and co-ceo ] craig mccaw , who ha a wireless network that i think i can piggyback off of [ ballmer laugh ] . so , ye , broadband is a bottleneck -- but i also think we have to look at ourslev as a softwar industri and say , 'are n't we , too , some of that bottleneck ?
