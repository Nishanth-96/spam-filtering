i ca n't see it either . i do howev disagre with joe in that it need to be number+mpixel to be use . valu is not alway necessarili defin by qualiti ( just look at number.numb ) . if i had a self-contain commun unit that let me share thing : document , the weather , my new hairdo , by newborn babi , etc . and it fit in my pocket then it might encourag me to share those thing more often . if we 're talk on the phone and you ask me what the weather is like and i say `` hang on '' , outstretch the devic with my arm extend , press a button , and instantli send you a pictur on me with blue sky in the background , that ha valu . but if i say `` hang on '' , fumbl around in my briefcas for a digit camera , and after number minut of plug and pray with usb final am abl to take a photo of me , bound by sever feet of cabl and multipl devic , well , that doe n't realli have valu . if i 'm a paparazzi i 'd love to be abl to send high-r photo use my mobil phone becaus that ha real econom impact , and i could put up with the hassl for the amount of time it save me . howev , i do n't think that is the market that sprint pc is contempl . the fact that sprint ha not made the assumpt that both the sender and recipi of the pictur are use their mobil phone will help thi surviv . get around the whole `` fax '' problem ( where both sender and receiv have to have fax in order for that technolog to be use ) . on the whole , not veri use for regular joe ( pun intend ) . put the camera in the phone ( even a low-r one ) and then it 'd at least be cool . -ian . on monday , august number , number , at number : number am , joseph s. barrera iii wrote : > rob shavel wrote : > > sprint , if you have n't seen the market yet , is numberst to us > > market w/postwap > > mobil data svc . to me , there is nada more interest and > > impact go > > down in the tech world than mobil visual communications.. and > > yet no one > > seem to give much of a damn that right now that number person can > > take photo > > and share them instantli across space . > > you 're right . or at least , i do n't . i saw an advert for it on tv > last night ( ca n't miss futurama : - ) and i thought , `` boy , that 's > dumb .
