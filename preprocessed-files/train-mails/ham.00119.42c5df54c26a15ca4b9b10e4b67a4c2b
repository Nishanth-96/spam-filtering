a while ago i ask what other packag i should optom for pentium . one person answer glibc . thi got me think about gcc itself , so i ask on anoth list and got a few answer , most were `` do n't even think about it '' but a few suggest gcc and one point me to linux from scratch . after have a good search around the lf site , i 've decid i 'm go to give it a whirl . i 've got a spare box and load of free time , so whi not ; - ) the lf site , howev warn not to use optim when compil gcc or glibc ? a quick googl found pgcc , a pentium optim patch for gcc , but the site doe not seem to have been updat in quit some time ? so , my gener plan , and i 'm take my time with thi : partit the hard drive for the lf set-up with number partit , / , /usr , /var and /home . instal a base debian system into the /home partit so i can build the rest of the system into the other partit . use debian , build the initi packag into the / and /usr partit . i 'll tri to optim gcc and glibc in thi first stage . chroot to the / partit and re-build the base packag for share lib . strip de-bug from the binari and chang the boot so the system boot from / rather than /home , then move /home to it 's proper partit . all go well , i should now have a full base linux system run that is fulli optim for my pentiummmx includ gcc and glibc . now i can build zlib and then x , again optim . and i can follow thi with the variou graphic lib , qt lib and final kde . if all goe well , i will probabl repeat thi for my dual system , onc i can find a match for the slotnumb numbermhz piii iv' got . i might even be tempt to write thi up for the site . cheer , john gay -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
