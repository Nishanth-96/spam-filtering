my take : if genet engin includ select breed , then it also includ human pair that are not randomli group . it doe n't matter if those two intend what they are do , they are engag in a 'select sort ' . it ha been brought up that a boss no longer marri hi secretari . now the femal law partner select anoth high earn mate ( at least associ law ) . so instead of two coupl make dollarnumberk a piec ( numberk + numberk ) you have one pair with dollarnumb and one pair with dollarnumb and thi ha some interest social effect . and one of those effect is the differ in their children ( on averag ) . > -- -- -origin messag -- -- - > from : emailaddr emailaddr on behalf of karl > anderson > sent : wednesday , juli number , number number : number pm > to : emailaddr > subject : re : [ baselin ] rais chicken the high-tech way > > elia sinderson write : > > > sorri , karl , your confus thing . > > no , it 's just a silli discuss , but that 's what picki semant > discuss turn into : ) > > > tho is say that select > > breed should be count as genet engin , wherea you are > > extend hi definit to includ the attrat that your parent > felt ... > > ye , i 'm say that if he extend `` genet engin '' to includ > select anim to breed , he must extend it to includ select > peopl to breed with . > > > unless your parent were select bred like livestock to produc you , > > i do n't think you can make that case ... : - ) > > i 'm say that my parent select each other , and that they did so > becaus ( among other reason ) each want the other 's gene to be > mix with their own in the offspr that they were plan . > > what doe it matter that they were select to produc their own > offspr , rather than the offspr of two unrel anim ? > > -- > karl anderson emailaddr httpaddr > httpaddr httpaddr
