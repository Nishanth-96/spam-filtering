'' yeah , i get that . i just think thi is a poor exampl . corpor bankruptci is a power fight between creditor , manag , and sharehold over control of asset . becaus a corpor is incorpor ( hee , hee ) , it ca n't be much els . if you 're concern about the imbal of power relat to corpor , i think the more relev area are tax structur , especi the incom tax , variou form of extern , law relat to employ , corpor transpar , and corpor govern . _________________________________________________________________ chat with friend onlin , tri msn messeng : httpaddr httpaddr
