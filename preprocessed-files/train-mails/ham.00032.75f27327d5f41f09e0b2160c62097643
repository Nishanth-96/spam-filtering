[ they could'nt actual hurt them as they onli eat fish/veri small rodent ] in the wild . but the cat got the fright of their live and now they just sit across the room from the fish warey of approach the glass ; - ) person i 've been bitten mani time , but onli drew blood onc so far . i wa n't to thank all that repli to my total ot mail , i never knew that so mani peopl were into our wee friend . cw -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - on sat , number jul number , kevin lyda wrote : > what is thi obsess of your with cat that hunt ? not my obsess - evolut . anyway.. i dont like mice and rat , esp . not in the hous . and we'v not had one in the hous sinc we got our present cat . > you realis that while cat will sometim bring bird to your bed , > it 's the wrong kind of bird ... : ) : ) it mostli mice though . and they will eventu ( after a few summer ) stop bring their kill back to the hous , onc they realis that you 're not interest and are never go to learn to hunt .
