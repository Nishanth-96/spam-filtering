my ideal mailwal will allow messag passthrough in mani way : - sender membership on my person whitelist or ani one of mani other extern whitelist i respect - payment of a small fee ( via a websit and paypal link ) - demonstr of special per-messag effort , either via ... - a comput challeng ( hashcash ) or - other challeng that requir human-level flexibl & followthrough ( sender manual whitelist ) - inclus of a legally-enforc guarante that the mail is not an unsolicit commerci pitch -- one exampl of thi class of guarante would be a post bond - by convinc some analysi softwar agent of mine that i want to see the mail , base on it content and distribut list there 's no need to do onli one . some might overlap ; the manual process for pass a messag through might requir the assert of a legally-enforc guarante about the messag ' content . pass certain test onc might add an address to the persist whitelist . ani slightli determin and legitim correspond would be abl to find multipl way to get their mail read , while spammer would face a situat where the margin cost of reach me is much , much greater than the expect return . some econom irrat spammer ( and religious/polit zealot ) would get through , but such traffic should be a background trickl rather than an annoy torrent . - gordon httpaddr
