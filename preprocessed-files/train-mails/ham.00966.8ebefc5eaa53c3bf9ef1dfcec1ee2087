'' the roundup that follow the attack , conduct with wartim urgenc and uncommon secreci , led to the detent of more than number , number peopl suspect of violat immigr law , be materi wit to terror or fight for the enemi . the govern 's effort ha produc few if ani law enforc coup . most of the detaine have sinc been releas or deport , with fewer than number still be held . but it ha provok a sprawl legal battl , now be wage in feder courthous around the countri , that expert say ha begun to redefin the delic balanc between individu liberti and nation secur . the main combat are the attorney gener and feder prosecutor on one side and a network of public defend , immigr and crimin defens lawyer , civil libertarian and some constitut scholar on the other , with feder judg in between . the govern 's record ha so far been decidedli mix . as it ha push civil liberti protect to their limit , the court , particularli at the trial level , have push back , stop well short of endors mr. ashcroft' tactic or the rational he ha offer to justifi them . feder judg have , howev , allow the govern to hold two american citizen without charg in militari brig , indefinit , incommunicado and without a road map for how they might even challeng their detent . in the nation 's histori , the greatest battl over the reach of govern power have occur against the backdrop of wartim . some scholar say the current restrict on civil liberti are rel minor by histor standard and in light of the risk the nation face . the current struggl center on three set of issu . peopl held simpli for immigr violat have object to new rule requir that their case be heard in secret , and they have leverag those challeng into an attack on what they call unconstitut prevent detent . peopl brought in and jail as materi wit , those thought to have inform about terrorist plot , have argu that they should not be held to give testimoni in grand juri investig . final , yasser esam hamdi and jose padilla , the two american label `` enemi combat '' for what the govern contend is more direct involv with terrorist group , are seek right onc thought to be fundament to american citizen , like a lawyer' represent and a chanc to challeng their detent befor a civilian judg . so far , feder judg in newark and detroit have order secret deport proceed open to public scrutini , and on friday a feder district judg in washington order that the ident of most of the detaine be made public under the freedom of inform act . `` secret arrest , '' judg gladi kessler wrote in the decis on friday , `` are a concept odiou to a democrat societi . '' a senior justic depart offici said the detent had been law and effect . he said it wa hard to '' prove a neg '' and cite specif terrorist act that had been disrupt . but he said that depart offici believ that the detent had `` incapacit and disrupt some ongo terrorist plan . '' two feder judg in new york have differ sharpli on whether the govern may jail materi wit while they wait to testifi in grand juri investig . in virginia , a feder judg order the govern to allow mr. hamdi to consult a lawyer . `` i look at the feder district court judg and just cheer them on , becaus they are do exactli what an independ judiciari should be do , '' said jane e. kirtley , a professor at the univers of minnesota and former execut director for the report committe for freedom of the press . `` it 's not hostil or adversari ; it 's simpli skeptic . '' these lower-court decis have for the most part not yet been test on appeal , and there is reason to think that appeal court and the suprem court will prove more sympathet to the govern 's tactic and argument . the feder appeal court in richmond , va. , for instanc , revers the decis to allow mr. hamdi to talk to a lawyer and order the lower court judg to consid addit evid and argument . but even the appeal court seem torn , and it reject the govern 's sweep argument that the court have no role in review the govern 's design of an american citizen as an enemi combat . the detent issu also carri an emot punch . mani of the arab and muslim caught in the govern dragnet were cabdriv , construct worker or other type of labor , and some spent up to seven month in jail befor be clear of terror tie and deport or releas . last month , at a confer held by a feder appeal court , warren christoph , the secretari of state in the clinton administr , snap at viet dinh , an assist attorney gener under presid bush , say that the administr 's refus to identifi the peopl it had detain remind him of the `` disappear '' in argentina . `` i 'll never forget go to argentina and see the mother march in the street ask for the name of those be held by the govern , '' mr. christoph said . `` we must be veri care in thi countri about take peopl into custodi without reveal their name . '' mr. dinh , who came to the unit state as a refuge from vietnam , recal hi famili 's anguish when hi father wa taken away in number for `` re-educ . '' in contrast , he said , those detain by the unit state were not be secretli held but were allow to go to the press and seek lawyer . `` these are not incognito detent , '' he said . `` the onli thing we will not do is provid a road map for the investig . '' accord to the justic depart , number of the more than number , number peopl detain sinc sept. number were held on immigr charg . offici said recent that number remain in detent . court paper indic there were about two dozen materi wit , while most of the other detaine were held on variou state and feder crimin charg . presid bush also ha announc plan to tri suspect foreign terrorist befor militari tribun , though no such charg have been brought yet . last month , william g. young , the feder judg presid in boston over the crimin case against richard c. reid , a british citizen accus of tri to deton a bomb in hi shoe on a trans-atlant flight , note that the veri establish of those tribun `` ha the effect of diminish the american juri , onc the central featur of american justic . '' judg young , who wa appoint by presid ronald reagan , ad : `` thi is the most profound shift in our legal institut in my lifetim and - most remark of all - it ha taken place without engag ani broad public interest whatsoev . '' jack goldsmith and cass r. sunstein , professor at the univers of chicago law school , have written that the bush administr 's polici are a minim challeng to civil liberti especi compar with chang dure the time of abraham lincoln and franklin d. roosevelt . what ha chang , they say , is a greater sensit to civil liberti and a vast increas in mistrust of govern . the secreci u.s. say hear are not trial ten day after last septemb 's attack , michael j. creppi , the nation 's chief immigr judg , quietli issu sweep instruct to hundr of judg for what would turn out to be more than number `` special interest '' immigr case . `` each of these case is to be heard separ from all other case on the docket , '' judg creppi wrote . `` the courtroom must be close for these case - no visitor , no famili , and no press . '' `` thi restrict , '' he continu , `` includ confirm or deni whether such a case is on the docket . '' the govern ha never formal explain how it decid which visa violat would be singl out for thi extraordinari process , and it ha insist that the design could not be review by the court . but as it turn out , most of these case involv arab and muslim men who were detain in fairli haphazard way , for exampl at traffic stop or through tip from suspici neighbor . law enforc offici have acknowledg that onli a few of these detaine had ani signific inform about possibl terrorist . as the rule on friday in washington suggest , a seri of legal challeng to thi secreci ha result in strike legal setback for the administr . sever court have order the proceed open and have voic consider skeptic about the govern 's justif for it detent polici gener . lee gelernt , a lawyer at the american civil liberti union , said the secreci of the proceed exacerb the hardship face by peopl who disappear from sight on violat that in the past would not have result in incarcer . `` prevent detent , '' he said , `` is such a radic departur from constitut tradit that we certainli should n't be undertak it sole on the justic depart 's say-so . '' malek zeidan 's detent would have been unexcept had it not given rise to one of the legal challeng that threaten to end the secret proceed . mr. zeidan , number , is a syrian citizen who overstay hi visa number year ago and ha live in paterson , n.j. , for more than a decad . over the year , he ha deliv pizza , driven an ice cream truck and pump ga . when the immigr and natur servic came around last jan. number to ask him about a former roommat suspect of marriag fraud , mr. zeidan wa work at dunkin ' donut , and hi expir visa soon cost him number day in custodi . when a hear wa final held three week after hi detent , the judg close the courtroom , exclud mr. zeidan 's cousin and report . the close of proceed prompt lawsuit in feder court , from both mr. zeidan and two new jersey newspap . in march , the govern drop the `` special interest '' design , mr. zeiden wa releas after post a bond , and the case he file wa dismiss . the immigr charg against him will be consid in the fall . `` you 're one of the lucki one , '' hi lawyer , regi fernandez , recal tell mr. zeidan , given that other visa violat were held as long as six or seven month befor be deport or releas . mr. zeidan 's lawyer believ that their legal strategi , which focus on open , forc the govern 's hand . `` the govern wa somehow link secreci to guilt , '' mr. fernandez said . `` we figur if the public had access to these hear they would see that noth went on except multipl adjourn and delay . '' through a spokeswoman , judg creppi declin to comment . an i.n. . offici , who spoke on the condit that he not be name , said the agenc had act properli in mr. zeidan' case and in similar case . he said the immigr servic had alway detain peopl without bond who were link to crimin investig . he ad that the agenc had no choic now but to detain a visa violat until the feder bureau of investig wa sure the person wa not involv in terror . `` consid the flip side - that you held him for two day and then deport him , and number day later you found out he wa a terrorist , '' the offici said . the newspap ' lawsuit ha continu . it ha alreadi onc reach the suprem court , and the govern 's paper contain one of the fullest account of it posit on secreci and execut power . it main argument is that the court have no role becaus immigr hear are not realli trial , but are mere administr hear that can be close at will . bennet zurofski , who also repres mr. zeidan , said he wa flabbergast by thi suggest . `` a trial is a trial , '' he said . `` a person 's liberti is at stake . a person is be held in jail . a person is be told where to live . '' but in a sworn statement submit in sever court case , dale l. watson , the execut assist director for counterterror and counterintellig at the f.b.i. , outlin the reason behind the govern demand for total secreci . `` bit and piec of inform that may appear innocu in isol can be fit into a bigger pictur by terrorist group , '' he said . thi rational for withhold inform , sometim call the mosaic theori , is controversi . `` it 's imposs to refut , '' professor kirtley said , '' becaus who can say with certainti that it 's not true ? '' in may , john w. bissel , the chief judg of the feder district court in newark , appoint by presid reagan , rule for the newspap and order all deport hear nationwid to be open , unless the govern is abl to show a need for a close hear on a case-by-cas basi . hi rule follow a similar one in detroit the month befor , though that case involv onli a singl detaine . the govern appeal to the court of appeal for the third circuit , in philadelphia , and ask it to block judg bissel 's order until the appeal wa decid . the court , which will hear argument in septemb , declin to do that . a number of news organ , includ the new york time , file a brief as a friend of the court in support of the newspap . the govern then ask the unit state suprem court to stay judg bissel 's order . the court , in a rel unusu move given that the case wa not befor it for ani other purpos , block judg bissel 's order , suggest that it might have more sympathi for the government' argument . the wit right violat , lawyer contend late on sept. number , feder agent pull two nervou indian men , moham jawe azmath and sy gul moham shah , off an amtrak train near fort worth . they were carri box cutter , black hair dye and about dollarnumb , number in cash and had also shave their bodi hair . the agent ' suspicion were obviou . the hijack had use box cutter and knive to take control of the aircraft and had receiv letter instruct them to `` shave excess hair from the bodi . '' an f.b.i . affidavit date sept. number said there wa probabl caus to believ that both of the indian men were involv in , or `` were associ '' with , those respons for the sept. number attack . but even though govern offici told report that the men had been detain as materi wit , their lawyer now say that they were held last fall onli on immigr violat . the distinct is import becaus a materi wit warrant bring the automat appoint of a government-paid lawyer , while the govern doe not have to suppli a visa violat with counsel . as a result , the author were abl to question each of the men repeatedli about terror without a lawyer present , their current lawyer say . like some of the peopl who were pick up as materi wit , the indian men were held in isol in jail in new york for extend period . it wa number day befor mr. azmath receiv a lawyer and number day befor mr. shah did , their lawyer say . `` it 's wrong to keep a man in jail for number day and never bring him befor a magistr to advis him of hi right , '' mr. shah 's lawyer , lawrenc k. feitel , said in an interview . `` it 's wrong not to provid him with an attorney at the threshold . it 's wrong to depict thi as an i.n. . investig , when in truth and in fact , it 's the main inquiri into the world trade center debacl . '' anthoni l. ricco , the lawyer for mr. azmath , said hi client wa interrog `` often time for sever hour a day , with multipl interview , get rapid-fir question from three or four differ peopl . '' eventu , the f.b.i . and the prosecutor clear the men of ani involv in terror , and both plead guilti in june in a credit-card fraud scheme and are await sentenc . feder prosecutor said in court paper that both men consent to question . each `` wa read and waiv hi miranda right befor each interview , '' prosecutor wrote , ad that each man confess to the credit card offens . the unit state attorney in manhattan , jame b. comey , would not comment on the specif case , but said gener of the govern 's tactic : `` i do n't see ani violat of ani rule , regul , or law . `` i can understand defens lawyer not be happi , '' he said . `` but i know our posit after number/numb wa to use everi avail tool , to stay within the rule but play the whole field and recogn the boundari , but cover the whole field . `` we need to do whatev we can that 's legal to investig and disrupt , '' he ad . today , it is believ that onli a hand of the two dozen materi wit , perhap as few as two , are still be detain . but the process of detain the wit ha stir intens critic . last april , judg shira a. scheindlin of feder district court in manhattan rule that the use of the law `` to detain peopl who are presum innoc under our constitut in order to prevent potenti crime is an illegitim use of the statut . '' judg scheindlin said the materi wit law appli when wit were held to give testimoni at trial , not for grand juri investig . `` sinc number , '' judg scheindlin said , `` no congress ha grant the govern the author to imprison an innoc person in order to guarante that he will testifi befor a grand juri conduct a crimin investig . '' then last month , chief judg michael b. mukasey , also of feder district court in manhattan , upheld the govern 's use of the materi wit statut in grand juri investig , critic judg scheindlin' reason . judg mukasey , cite the assert in number by chief justic john marshal that `` the public ha a right to everi man 's evid , '' held that detent of materi wit dure investig are proper . the war captiv no lawyer allow under u.s. label yasser esam hamdi , a saudi nation who wa captur in afghanistan , is probabl an american citizen by virtu of have been born in louisiana . hi case repres the core issu of what kind of role the nation 's court should have , if ani , in review the govern 's imprison of someon charg with someth akin to a war crime . prosecutor will be back in feder district court in norfolk , va. , next thursday to confront one of the feder judg who ha shown resist to the government' approach that onc someon is declar an `` enemi combat '' by the presid , all judici review ceas . judg robert g. doumar , an appointe of presid reagan , ha twice rule that mr. hamdi is entitl to a lawyer and order the govern to allow frank dunham , the feder public defend , to be allow to visit him without govern offici or listen devic . judg doumar said that `` fair play and fundament justic '' requir it . he said the govern `` could not cite one case where a prison of ani varieti within the jurisdict of a unit state district court , who wa held incommunicado and indefinit . '' but the three-judg panel of the appeal court stay judg doumar 's order , say he had not fulli consid the govern 's need to keep mr. hamdi incommunicado and , more import , the execut branch 's primaci in area of foreign and militari affair . `` the author to captur those who take up arm against america belong to the command in chief , '' chief judg j. harvi wilkinson numberrd wrote for the appeal panel . but even judg wilkinson seem to evinc some surpris at the breadth of what the govern wa assert when he ask the justic depart 's lawyer , `` you are say that the judiciari ha no right to inquir at all into someone' statur as an enemi combat ? '' the govern ha relent slightli , agre to provid the court with a seal declar of the criteria by which they have judg mr. hamdi to be an enemi combat . but the govern ha argu that judg can not argu with the standard . judg doumar ha indic that he will question the govern close on those standard . the case of jose padilla , which ha not progress as far as that of mr. hamdi , may present an even greater challeng to normal judici procedur . mr. padilla , also known as abdullah al-muhajir , is , like mr. hamdi , an american citizen , imprison in a naval brig after have been declar an enemi combat . but unlik mr. hamdi , mr. padilla wa not arrest on the battlefield by the militari but on unit state soil by civil law enforc author , on may number in chicago . after hi detent as a materi wit base on suspicion that he wa seek to obtain materi and inform to build a radioact bomb , he wa transfer to militari custodi . `` thi is the model we all fear or should fear , '' said mr. dunham , the public defend . `` the execut branch can arrest an american citizen here and then declar him an enemi combat and put him outsid the reach of the court . they can keep him indefinit without charg him or give him access to a lawyer or present ani evid .
