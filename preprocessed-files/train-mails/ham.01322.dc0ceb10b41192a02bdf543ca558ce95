i rig thi up for test befor i commit to a sitewid rollout of spamassassin as an smtp relay . it is more work , but it avoid sitewid chang in mail deliveri dure the earli stage of test . on the exchang server ... ( mail.yourdomain.com ) creat a new , privat smtp address emailaddr for the mailbox you want to protect . remov the old address . creat a `` custom recipi '' with the old smtp address emailaddr creat anoth custom recipi point at a local user on the spamassassin box emailaddr set the first custom recipi to forward all mail to the second custom recipi . ( must forward to anoth address in the exchang directori ) on the spamassassin box ... ( filtermail.yourdomain.com ) set up a dummi user , in thi case `` killspam '' give killspam a .forward file point to the final recipi 's new , privat smtp address back on the exchang server . so the messag flow is like thi : mail arriv on the exchang server mail.yourdomain.com for emailaddr emailaddr forward it to emailaddr follow the .forward file , the e-mail is then forward to emailaddr wowi zowi it work . the first address i protect wa myself , the second one i protect wa postmast . as you can see , you must creat two custom recipi in exchang and one dummi account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address you want to protect . like i said , it is more work , but until i am done load-test , thi is the way it will stay . -jake -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - thi sf.net email is sponsor by : thinkgeek welcom to geek heaven . httpaddr _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mail list emailaddr httpaddr
