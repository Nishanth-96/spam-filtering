on august numberth , an entiti known as `` idefens '' sent out an announc , which is append to thi email . briefli , `` idefens '' , which bill itself as `` a global secur intellig compani '' , is offer cash for inform about secur vulner in comput softwar that are not publicli known , especi if you promis not to tell anyon els . if thi kind of secret traffic is allow to continu , it will pose a veri seriou threat to our comput commun infrastructur . at the moment , the domin paradigm for comput secur research known as `` full disclosur '' ; peopl who discov secur vulner in softwar tell the vendor about them , and a short while later -- - after the vendor ha had a chanc to fix the problem -- - they publish the inform , includ code to exploit the vulner , if possibl . thi method ha proven far superior to the old paradigm establish by cert in the late number , which it propon might call `` respons disclosur '' -- - never releas work exploit code , and never releas ani inform on the vulner befor all vendor have releas a patch . thi procedur often left hundr of thousand of comput vulner to known bug for month or year while the vendor work on featur , and often , even after the patch were releas , peopl would n't appli them becaus they did n't know how seriou the problem wa . the underground comput crimin commun would often discov and exploit these same hole for month or year while the `` respons disclosur '' process kept their victim , who had no connect in the underground , vulner . the problem with thi is that vulner that are wide known are much less danger , becaus their victim can take step to reduc their potenti impact -- - includ disabl softwar , turn off vulner featur , filter traffic in transit , and detect and respond to intrus . they are therefor much less use to would-b intrud . also , softwar compani usual see secur vulner in their softwar as pr problem , and so prefer to delay public ( and the expens of fix the bug ) as long as possibl . idefens is offer a new altern that appear far more danger than either of the two previou paradigm . they want to be a buyer in a marketplac for secret softwar vulner inform , reward discover of vulner with cash . not long befor , snosoft , a group of secur research evid includ some crimin element , appar made an offer to sell the secreci of some softwar vulner inform to the softwar vendor ; specif , they appar made a privat offer to hewlett-packard to keep a vulner in hp 's trunumb unix secret if hp retain snosoft 's `` consult servic '' . hp consid thi extort and respond with legal threat , and snosoft publish the inform . if thi is allow to happen , it will caus two problem which , togeth , add up to a catastroph . first , secret softwar vulner inform will be avail to the highest bidder , and to nobodi els . for reason explain later , i think the highest bidder will gener be organ crime syndic , although that will not be obviou to the seller . second , find softwar vulner and keep them secret will becom lucr for mani more talent peopl . the result will be -- - just as in the `` respons disclosur '' day -- - that the good guy will remain vulner for month and year , while the major of current vulner are kept secret . i 've heard it argu that the highest bidder will gener be the vendor of the vulner softwar , but i do n't think that' plausibl . if someon can steal dollarnumb number becaus a softwar bug let them , the softwar vendor is never held liabl ; often , in fact , the peopl who administ the softwar are n't liabl , either -- - when credit card data are stolen from an e-commerc site , for exampl . know about a vulner befor anyon els might save a web-sit administr some time , and it might save the softwar vendor some neg pr , but it can net the thief thousand of dollar . i think the highest bidder will be those for whom earli vulner inform is most lucr -- - the thiev who can use it to execut the largest heist without get caught . inevit , that mean organ crime syndic , although the particular gang who are good at network theft may not yet exist . there might be the occasion case where a market leader , such as microsoft , could make more money by give their competitor bad pr than a gang could make by theft . think of a remote-root hole in samba , for exampl . right now , peopl who know how to find secur exploit are either motiv by person interest in the subject , motiv by the public interest , motiv by a desir for individu recognit , or person know crimin that benefit from their exploit . creat a marketplac in secret vulner inform would vastli increas the avail of that inform to the peopl who can afford to pay the most for it : spi , terrorist , and organ crime . let 's not let that happen . thi is the origin idefens announc : from : sunil jame emailaddr sent : wednesday , august number , number number : number pm subject : introduc idefens 's vulner contributor program greet , idefens is pleas to announc the offici launch of it vulner contributor program ( vcp ) . the vcp pay contributor for the advanc notif of vulner , exploit code and malici code . idefens hope you might consid contribut to the vcp . the follow provid answer to some basic question about the program : q. how will it work ? a. idefens understand the major of secur research do not publish secur research for compens ; rather , it could be for ani of a number of motiv , includ the follow : * pure love of secur research * the desir to protect against harm to target network * the desir to urg vendor to fix their product * the public that often accompani disclosur the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the internet commun , but who would also like to be paid for do the work.th compens will depend , among other thing , on the follow item : * the kind of inform be share ( i.e . vulner or exploit ) * the amount of detail and analysi provid * the potenti sever level for the inform share * the type of applic , oper system , and other softwar and hardwar potenti affect * verif by idefens lab * the level of exclus , if ani , for data grant to idefens q. who should contribut to the vcp ? a. the vcp is open to ani individu , secur research group or other entiti . q. whi are you launch thi program ? a. timeli remain a key aspect in secur intellig . contribut to some list take time befor public to the public at larg . more often , mani of these servic charg client for access without pay the origin contributor . under the idefens program , the contributor is compens , idefens lab verifi the issu , and idefens client and the public at larg are warn in a time manner . q. who get the credit ? a. the contributor is alway credit for discov the vulner or exploit inform . q. when can i contribut ? the vcp is activ . you are welcom to begin contribut today . to learn more , go to httpaddr if you have question or would like to sign up as a contributor to the vcp , pleas contact us at emailaddr regard , sunil jame technic analyst idefens '' idefens is a global secur intellig compani that proactiv monitor sourc throughout the world -- from technic vulner and hacker profil to the global spread of virus and other malici code . the ialert secur intellig servic provid decision-mak , frontlin secur profession and network administr with time access to action intellig and decis support on cyber-rel threat . idefens lab is the research wing that verifi vulner , examin the behavior of exploit and other malici code and discov new software/hardwar weak in a control lab environ .
