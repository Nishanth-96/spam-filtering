'' oookaaaay ... httpaddr iconoclast design choos mip by anthoni cataldo may number , number san jose , calif. -- a group of engin in calabasa hill , ca want to turn the microprocessor world on it head by do the unthink : toss out the clock and let the signal move about unencumb . for those design , inspir by research conduct at nearbi caltech , clock are for wimp . the fulcrum microsystem inc. design team is n't the first to propos an asynchron processor , but presid and chief execut offic robert nunn want to be the first to take a clockless , fire-breath processor mainstream . `` we realli deal with an asynchron world , '' he said . `` we onli make it synchron for our own conveni . '' thi is the kind of stuff that mani in the processor industri would consid lunat fring , too weird for conserv embedded-system design . but the young processor compani and more than a dozen other like it are anchor in the mainstream courtesi of the mip instruction-set architectur . more and more , mip is becom the choic for maverick processor design team seek a place at the high end by field unorthodox devic . and if motorola and ibm in the powerpc camp are n't care , they could see their perform leadership in the high-end embedded-processor market snatch away by some of these upstart . in austin , texa , meanwhil , design at anoth mip hous , intrins inc. , are n't prepar to ditch the clock . but they are put a new spin on some old trick such as give each gate it own clock and then let them overlap . use such sleight of hand , the compani hope to soon deliv risc-bas processor that run at an eye-pop number ghz and consum just number to number watt . fulcrum , intrins and their brethren may onc have been written off as interest experi , back by ventur capitalist who overlook some of the finer detail , like softwar compat . what lend them respect is mip . their for the ask one reason young processor compani seem to be flock to the platform is that it steward , mip technolog inc. , ha no qualm about licens the instruction-set architectur ( isa ) , provid that the license agre to meet a software-compat test suit . by contrast , processor-cor rival arm ltd. ha grant thi privileg to just two of it mani license , intel and motorola . and so far , the two powerpc vendor , ibm corp. and motorola inc. , have rebuf most request to licens that architectur , with the notabl except be fpga vendor xilinx inc. , which ha licens the number powerpc from ibm . the mip isa is also one of the simplest form of reduced-instruction-set comput around , which tend to make it attract to processor design interest in extend the architectur . it wa thi and the wide avail of tool and softwar that drew intrins to mip , even though the compani is aim at powerpc socket , as evidenc by it decis to adopt the rapidio interfac instead of hypertransport , which ha been favor by mip vendor . good fit '' it 's a nice , clean architectur and ha an open model that allow us to add instruct , '' said paul nixon , chief execut offic of intrins . `` you also get all the third-parti tool that veri easili fit into our base of platform . '' there wa a time when thi open wa seen as a liabil for mip . in the mid-numb , befor mip wa spun out from silicon graphic inc. , the instruct set lack a multiply-add instruct , so some mip vendor took it upon themselv to creat their own . the problem wa that thi broke mani of the develop tool , caus headach for compil vendor like green hill softwar inc. '' we went to mip and said we have number differ compil variant and it 's embarrass , '' said craig franklin , vice presid of engin at green hill and a respect microprocessor industri veteran . franklin also wa n't shi about tell mip it need to revamp it embed applic binari interfac . `` we went to mip and said we 've done a dozen eabi , let 's clean up your , '' he said . mip took the advic and wast littl time clamp down on architectur deviat , observ said . but the mip camp still ha to live with a legaci of incompat chip in the field . `` to it credit , mip quickli caught on , '' said jim turley , a microprocessor industri analyst . `` go forward , mip is maintain good control but they are still haunt by incompat among multipl . '' if the biggest risk to the mip camp is fragment , then the powerpc camp ha the opposit problem : architectur confin . though the powerpc architectur carri the cachet of household name motorola and ibm , these are essenti the onli two compani that provid powerpc . it 's not for lack of interest . rather , the compani have been reluct to cede control over the architectur . thi could wind up hurt the powerpc caus , though . `` to get a powerpc licens is imposs or veri expens , '' green hills' franklin said . `` tactic thi may have been a mistak . if you 're a japanes compani , all thing be equal , you 'd rather buy from anoth japanes compani . '' analyst turley , too , think the powerpc camp will onli stand to gain by licens the architectur . `` it 's all about softwar compat and tool support . the more you can prolifer the architectur the better you 're go to do , '' he said . `` i do n't think motorola and ibm can address the entir market by themselv . '' there 's a chanc that thi could chang . ibm , for it part , is in the process of plan an expans strategi for powerpc that may involv more licens . though it 's unlik the powerpc camp will ever have the open licens model of mip technolog , mip processor vendor may have more than just two competitor to worri about . `` we 're certainli not avers to [ licens ] , '' said lisa su , director of powerpc product at ibm . `` the question is , how much do we do and who do we licens to . there are variou way you could go , whether it 's a hard core , soft core or licens the isa . '' but the fear of architectur fragment still loom larg . `` we know that if we have differ microarchitectur we have to do work on softwar compat , '' su said . `` with mip there 's a degre of fractur . that may not alway be a big problem , but if you go to other market -- like consum -- it becom big . our belief is there is a happi medium . '' whatev path ibm take it will act in it own best interest as a chip provid , not as a compani that want to hawk intellectu properti . thi is whi the xilinx licens deal work for ibm : big blue is not so much interest in the royalti and fee it collect from xilinx , but in the dual benefit of widen the appeal of the architectur and the revenu ibm gener from manufactur the fpga for xilinx in it own fab . `` we 're not tri to make money off of licens , '' su said . manufactur is probabl one of the most power weapon that powerpc vendor ibm and motorola wield . both have gussi up their high-end line with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insul technolog , still rariti among chip maker . thi ha help both compani design rel low-pow embed processor run at number ghz that are ship today . ibm did it use number.number-micron design rule and a four-stag pipelin ; motorola is use number.number-micron design rule and a seven-stag pipe . the compani say there 's more perform headroom in store . `` when we get to number.numb micron we 'll get substanti faster , '' said raj handa , powerpc and powerquicc market manag at motorola . proprietari process most mip processor vendor , by contrast , reli on mainstream foundri that have n't develop the more-exot process technolog . and even though compani like motorola are shift more capac to outsid foundri , they 're keep their special process recip in-hous to juic up their high-perform devic . lack thi capabl , most mip processor vendor will have littl choic but to come up with dazzl architectur feat to keep up their chop at the high end . it should becom clear in the next year or so how some of the newer player measur up . intrins hope to field it number-ghz processor by the end of the year . fulcrum is shoot for an earli number introduct . `` we 're go to shock the industri in term of raw perform and speed-vs.-pow perform , '' fulcrum 's nunn said . `` we realli want to chang the way the world design semiconductor .
