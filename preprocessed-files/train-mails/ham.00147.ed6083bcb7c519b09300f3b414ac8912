( apart from ipfw be in use a lot longer ) . well , as someon who 's use ipchain quit heavili about two year ago , i can guarante you that the learn curv for read ipchain rule and ipfw rule is quit differ . of cours onc you 've memoris ( not necessarili sit down with a sheet of them and learn them off by rote ) them , you wonder what all the fuss is about befor . it 's not in itself a reason to choos one firewal product over anoth , but if that 's all there is in the differ , and the learn curv for the oper system is the same , then i know what i 'd prefer , as a beginn . thi is all get rather off-top now anyway , but sinc i'v been do quit a lot of work with ipfw over the last week i jump on the bandwagon . -- philip reynold rfc network tel : number number www.rfc-networks.i fax : number number -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
