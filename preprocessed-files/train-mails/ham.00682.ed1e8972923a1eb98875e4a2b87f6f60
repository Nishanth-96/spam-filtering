is there a rel clean way to dynam build comp file base on the path of the current folder ? yeah , i know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the current folder to the mail root , but that 's not what i want . i 'm start to use plu address heavili as part of my spam control . specif i each mail list with a list-specif address . eg i would subscrib to thi list as emailaddr or perhap emailaddr instead of emailaddr howev to do thi i need a new set of comp file for each list folder . as i 'm subscrib to someth just over number list , that 's rather a pain . i realli do n't want to go creat and maintain ~number , number comp file ( compon , replcomp , replgroupcomp ) , especi not as i suspect i 'll be chang or adapt my name pattern a few time as i adapt variou support tool . what would be great is if i could build the relev comp file dynam at runtim . that way i do n't need to maintain a coupl thousand comp file , i just need to make my plu address predictable/comput base ( say ) on the folder path . eg i 'm current in folder : +-lists-/products/exmh-l the script would dynam build a compfil which had a from : of emailaddr for repl , comp , etc . similarli when in folder : +-lists-/linux/svlug-l i 'd get a from : of emailaddr that way i can use lookup tabl for those folder which have multipl list be deliv into them . ani idea how thi might be done in an automatic/maintain fashion ? it would be more than good enough if all i had to do wa drop a tini from_head file in each folder that somehow got pick up by the comp file ... -- j c lawrenc -- -- -- -- - ( * ) satan , oscil my metal sonata . emailaddr he live as a devil , eh ? httpaddr evil is a name of a foeman , as i live . _______________________________________________ exmh-us mail list emailaddr httpaddr
