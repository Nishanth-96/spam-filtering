( not that there 's anyth wrong with that ! ) number two , rfid . radio-frequ id == got ta have some tagger . got ta be on the net . it 'd be nice if they had some power processor in them . someth intern , pervas , a littl comput action that is go on insid physic object . number three , wireless broadband . get real close here . number four , dongl . i think thi part is serious underappreci . thi is the weird part of ubicomp , the part that may turn out to be it achil heel : some way to turn the damn thing off . and to *know* it 's off . the problem of the author user . the author administr , the author access . thi is like to play out as ubicomp 's function equival of the internet 's intellectual-properti problem . in other word , it 's a veri seriou issu which is go to be neglect from the get-go , as peopl are eagerli build the basic infrastructur . then , as they lame tri to build it in later , they are go to find out that they have inadvert poison the water-stream for everybodi . you do n't want to wander into a kazaa and napster version of georg orwel . ubiquit comput , unlik inform , doe not `` want to be free . '' thi is not a technolog of freedom . ubiquit comput want to make you it slave . tri to rememb that , for all our sake , all right ? thi is not a water-cool for gossip , like the internet is . thi is a hard-cas , hard-tim , hands-on , rather ruthless command-and-control system . number five , gp , global posit system . been there , done that . number six , convoy traffic . i think thi is also underestim , for when i start look at seriou applic for ubicomp , time and again , rapidli ship larg amount of physic materi in and out of the ubicomp zone is a killer applic . get stuff in , number it , assembl it , move it out . lot of it . train load , truck load , bu load . and airlift . bring up the van , a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff , of vari degre of use and practic . high speed fiber optic network , check . massiv storag and router , check . big databas , check , but they need to be fast and flexibl . some `` mobihoc '' action : mobil ad-hoc self- assembl network : network that are alway reconfigur in real-tim , alway on the move . facial recognit ha a consider number of ubicomp applic , by no mean all of them good . human presence-sens system ? oh ye . rugged hardwar suitabl for outdoor deploy in all condit and weather . real-tim simul of ongo major situat . toxin detector of variou kind , environment monitor of almost everi sort , biometr id ... i have a long list of these . i 'm cross-check them . i 'm use them to build scenario . one thing about number.net make it veri distinct from earlier vision of ubicomp . thi is not microsoft window for housekeep . thi is a hard , tough web that you throw down fast over dire emerg . the key concept here is that we are final move comput out of the ivori tower , for good and all . no more glass box of the number , no more clean abstract of cyberspac . we are deploy comput at unheard-of speed , into the darkest , dirtiest , most danger place in the world . it is a resili secur apparatu for emerg . that is number.net . now , you might well argu that ubicomp is veri invas of privaci . that 's just what my industri design pal said about it , immedi , and they were right . it 's been hard to find reason deploy for ubicomp in peacetim commerc and in privat home , becaus it is so orwellian . howev . under certain circumst , other social circumst do trump thi issu . for instanc , when you are breath your last under a pile of earthquak rubbl , you do n't realli care much about privaci under your circumst . what you realli want is a smart bulldoz , a tourniquet , and some direct pressur against your open wound . and that is what number.net is about == or will be about , should it find it way out of the computer-sci talking-shop and into daylight . it is an emerg respons system for the planet 's open wound . and those wound exist in plenti . there are more of them all the time . i rather doubt that the orwellian version of ubicomp ha much of a futur . that 's a scenario that i have dub `` terrorspac '' , which is ubicomp in the context of airport and nuclear power site . if you 've been in airport recent , i believ you are see a pretti apt , earli version of terrorspac . at ani random moment , you can have your possess rifl through by stranger . your shoe are scan , and variou small but vital object in your pocket can be confisc by semi- educ secur geek . they 're either pathet under-train for the job ( in which case you certainli feel no safer ) , or els they are intellig and capabl peopl ( in which case you piti them and wish they had some other job , for the sake of gener human happi and the gnp ) . rather than make us ani safer , terrorspac airport serv as polit indoctrin center that humili our vote popul on a broad scale . they are meant to inur us to ever-escal level of government clumsi and gener harm . the difficulti with thi terrorspac approach is that airport and airlin are go broke . airport are hemorrhag money tri to maintain thi terrorspac apparatu . it is like to spread to the brittl power of nuclear power plant , nuclear wast dump , bio-sit , chemic site , liquid petroleum ga center and so forth . that will huge increas the overhead of all these danger industri . that 's a veri consider tax burden . so , though terrorspac may serv as a full employ program for the loyal and slightli stupid , that 's not go to pay off social or econom in the long run . howev , number.net is a differ matter . an air- deploy number.net that allow first respond to rapidli deal with fire , flood and other major disast would *save* money , especi for the insur , who are alreadi on the rope . the actual septemb number event , number/numb , wa a rare and remark thing . and , with fewer than number , number peopl dead , it 's just not that big a deal as genuin catastroph go . polit , theolog and militarili it wa huge , but a workaday number.net would n't fret much about terror . instead , it would have to deal mostli with flood , fire , climat chang , earthquak , volcano and ( let 's hope never ) asteroid and weapon of mass destruct . so , basic , with number.net , we are describ a social re-definit of comput geek as firemen . nativ twenty-first centuri comput geek as muscular , with-it , first-respond type . i think thi would be pretti good for the comput industri . we all need to take the dysfunct physic world far more serious . thi week , itali 's flood , texa is flood , colorado 's on fire . thi morn , the brand-new wilder forest around the site of the former chernobyl are on fire , spew radioact ash hither and yon . chunk of antarctica the size of rhode island have fallen into the sea . i could go on . thi is the sort of activ that human is requir to deal with in thi new centuri . if we build a success method with which to do thi , those use tactic will spread across the fabric of our civil . i believ they are alreadi spread . an innov like number.net will like serv as a camel 's nose in the tent for a whole seri of ubicomp applic across societi . i 've been specul about these new form of ubicomp , and give them some flashi neolog , becaus that is what scienc fiction writer bring to the tabl . we build littl scenario world and make up name for them . first we 've got `` number.net , '' then `` terrorspac , '' but there are other . battlespac . a term alreadi much-us by the pentagon . battlespac mean militari cnumberisr . the `` revolut in militari affair . '' i would point out that the militari , unlik some sector , is not reneg on their enthusiast commit to the digit revolut . on the contrari . i have n't seen anybodi in the militari say that they long to go back to the good-old-fashion , solid , easy-to- understand method of the war in vietnam . the militari are veri into `` network-centr warfar , '' and they could n't be happier about their spysat and surveil drone . prosthet ubicomp . thi is eldercar . a huge , steadili grow market . alzheim 's diseas is a flat-out domest catastroph that last seven year . ani comput help here == in elder-proof space , track the sick and so forth == would be of huge benefit to societi . cradle.net . babi have no privaci . children have littl privaci . child-proof a room against a crawl tot ... if you 've ever done thi , you can realiz how much use it might be to have thi process autom . ani two-year-old alway wonder : `` whi ca n't mr fork and miss wall socket be friend ? '' a real-tim checklist , at the veri least ! and then we 're face with the interest , large-scal prospect of `` k-number.net . '' street.net . thi would be traffic manag and urban system manag . water network , power network , subway , sidewalk and so forth . punish.net . two million peopl are in the american prison popul . they 've got no privaci . they 've got ta be watch all the time . they 're basic cram in iron cage now . industri ubicomp . manag suppli chain , industri assembl and so forth . thi will eventu be the biggest applic . so/ho ubicomp . ubicomp in the home , the home offic and small offic . some veri interest consum use here , but in the grand scheme of thing , not that big a deal . safetyspac . these would be militari base , u.n. safeti zone , refuge camp , and disast evacu center . it 's fairli easi to imagin ubiquit comput as a sinist `` gate commun '' that wall off privileg area under threat . but we can also think of it as import some human comfort , solidar , merci and safeti into variou benight area that are sever disturb . one can imagin a gorazd un safe zone version of thi , new and improv of cours : a black helicopt ghost over in the dead of night , deploy a scatter of small drone , smart-min and sensor , and suddenli the war just stop within these bound of safetyspac . rapin , loot , sack , smash and burn are rule out of exist through comput awar . the handi of a techniqu like that for life in the numberst centuri ... well , it might be a bit underestim . and last , come up with a bullet should the good time return in all their carefre glori : ubitopia . thi i take to be ubicomp as an urban entertain destin . you go there for fun just becaus there is cool , wacki stuff embed in the physic world , and it 's behav in a way that bring joy and hilar and good spirit , like the funhous mirror at a digit carniv . when and if ubitopia realli hit , it will mean that human 's basic relationship with our materi good ha been radic redefin . that is the apotheosi of ubiquit comput . just : materi good , and the way we deal with them , are differ . differ in charact , differ in qualiti . not recogniz by numberth centuri standard . so . i have no idea if the homeland secur depart , or fema or darpa or the nsf , are go to poni up ani money for ani of these notion . that 's not my lookout . i 'm a scienc fiction writer . and ladi and gentlemen , with thi materi , i have struck platinum . thi stuff is realli hot . thi is a great , attract , contemporari idea that is realli new , realli differ , and realli omin . the implic are huge and they spread across the board of societi . i am go to be a veri busi guy with thi materi . if you want to help me , send some email . thank a lot for your attent . o=c=o o=c=o o=c=o it 's here it 's there it 's everywher o=c=o o=c=o o=c=o
