first , number , number peopl will have seen the piec of spam that could 've been avoid . but the other number , number will never see that spam . evenli distribut , it mean that an averag user will onli see number % of spam . that 's not realist , becaus not everyon will get the same spam , but the basic threshold can be adjust . at the veri least , number peopl need to `` vote '' on a given piec of mail to make a realist decis . sinc there 's no `` no '' vote mechan ( except revoc -- and that 's after the fact ) , onli a `` ye '' vote mechan exist and so if you receiv number `` ye '' vote then you could safe say that you got a reason sampl . the system could pretend to have never seen the piec of mail until after it determin that it wa probabl spam . so instead of a rate go up increment , it would take a big leap at the begin ( from undefin to a rel high number ) and then go from there . so after the first group of peopl ( our sampler , we 'll say ) have seen the spam , no one els would ever see it . as far as unsubscrib , i 'm alway leeri of click on the link ( and do n't do so unless i specif rememb sign up for someth ) , but the sampl popul will decid for themselv whether they feel that it 's spam . so ultim , i guess i 'm say that the most effect rout would be to use a constantli chang sampl pool and just accept that there is some fraction of user that will have to see the spam . in a system that depend on peopl decid whether or not someth is spam , is there ani other way ?
