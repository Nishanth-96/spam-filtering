it might work for primat or even human , & quot ; claim ina dobrinski of the univers of pennsylvania , one of the co-author of the studi . if so , the techniqu could be use to preserv the reproduct potenti of male cancer patient about to undergo therapi that would destroy their abil to make sperm . men often freez sperm sampl befor receiv chemotherapi , but young boy can not do thi becaus they do not produc matur sperm . if it work in human , the techniqu would allow testi tissu graft from boy to matur and produc sperm . infecti particl the mous graft techniqu also ha an advantag over anoth option for preserv fertil - testicular transplant . these involv re-impl preserv germ cell into the test after cancer remiss . but the graft approach & quot ; would elimin ani possibl of pass cancer cell back to the patient , & quot ; say reproduct biologist michael griswold from washington state univers . howev , it is possibl that the graft procedur could introduc mouse-deriv infecti particl into human embryo , make some scientist wari of the idea . & quot ;
