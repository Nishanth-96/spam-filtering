from : donald eastlak numberrd juli number , number by yonder bless moon , sleuth decod life and art by leon jaroff on it way back from the pacif island of tinian , where it had deliv the uranium core for the atom bomb that destroy hiroshima , the heavi cruiser indianapoli wa torpedo by the japanes submarin i-numb and sent to the bottom of the philippin sea . it wa one of the worst disast in american naval histori ; onli number of it nearli number , number crew member surviv . now expert at southwest texa state univers have given that tragic stori a startl new twist . it wa the moon , they say , that sank the indianapoli . or anyway , they write in the juli issu of sky & telescop , it wa the moon that made the sink possibl . use astronom comput program , record and weather report , as well as the known coordin and run speed of the ship and the submarin that sank it , the author determin that when the i-numb surfac , it wa perfectli align , west to east , with the cruiser . and , they said , a three-quart moon had just emerg from behind the cloud . look across the moonlit water , an i-numb crewman spot the ship silhouet against the sky , number.numb mile away . half an hour later , six torpedo sent it to the bottom . `` it wa sheer chanc , '' said dr. donald olson , an astronom . `` without that align with the moon , the lookout would not have spot the cruiser , especi at that distanc . '' with russel doescher , a physic lectur , dr. olson conduct a univers honor cours call `` astronomi in art , histori and literatur . '' in the last number year , he ha pinpoint the time and place of the render of art masterpiec , given new interpret of astronom refer in chaucer and reveal the decis role of the moon in militari and other encount . two year ago , for exampl , dr. olson turn hi attent to the bright star in van gogh 's `` white hous at night . '' he and some student went to auver , franc , where van gogh creat hi final work , and search until they found the hous , larg unchang . sift through letter from van gogh to hi brother , dr. olson found that the paint wa complet in june number . note the orient of the hous in the paint , he determin where van gogh had set hi easel and what section of the sky he had portray , and from the light and shadow , he establish that the hous had been illumin by the set sun . hi comput analysi then identifi the `` star . '' it wa venu , which in earli even in mid-jun had occupi that part of the sky . a final check of local weather record pinpoint the actual date van gogh had compos the paint , june number , the onli clear day in the middl of the month that year . dr. olson ha also turn hi attent to shakespear , intrigu by the open of `` hamlet , '' when guard on the rampart of elsinor refer to the '' star that 's westward from the pole had made hi cours to illum that part of heaven where now it burn . '' from the guard ' descript , the season and the time , other astronom had suggest sever bright star as possibl , but dr. olson 's calcul place it in the constel cassiopeia , which lack ani notabl lumin star . ponder thi problem on a trip with hi wife , dr. olson wa suddenli inspir . he wa awar that in number , a supernova , call tycho 's star , for the danish astronom tycho brahe , suddenli flame in cassiopeia , creat a worldwid sensat . shakespear , number at the time , would certainli have recal the event , and hi memori wa probabl refresh by the descript of the supernova in a histori book that wa the sourc of some of hi best-known play . dr. olson ha no doubt that the star that glare abov elsinor that night wa tycho 's , and he ha an impress record of other astronomy-bas sleuth . awar that the photograph ansel adam often neglect to date hi neg , dr. olson set out to find when adam had shot hi classic '' moon and half dome . '' at yosemit , dr. olson and hi student found adam 's vantag point , studi the locat , phase and featur of the moon in the photograph , plu the shadow on the dome , snow on the peak and other clue , and then announc that the pictur had been taken at number : number p.m. , dec. number , number . then , dr. olson calcul that the set would be virtual ident at number : number p.m. on dec. number , number . on that day adam 's daughter-in-law visit yosemit and wa photograph hold a print of `` moon and the half dome '' in the foreground of an eerili similar view of the actual moon and the half dome . analyz chaucer 's work , dr. olson ha confirm that a particularli rapid movement of the moon describ in `` the merchant 's tale '' occur in april number . and in `` the franklin 's tale , '' chaucer 's descript of the heavenli align that caus an except high tide on the brittani coast , convinc dr. olson that chaucer wa an advanc amateur astronom . then there wa paul rever . on hi way to saddl up for hi famou ride , how did he manag to row undetect past a british warship on a moonlit night in boston harbor ? dr. olson 's comput program reveal that , while the moon wa nearli full that night , it wa unusu close to the southern horizon and did not illumin rever 's boat . dr. olson 's proudest achiev wa explain `` the tide that fail '' in the bloodi marin corp land at tarawa atol on nov. number , number . planner had expect a tide to provid a water depth of five feet over a reef some number yard from shore , allow larger land craft , with draft of at least four feet , to pass . but that day and the next , in the word of some observ , `` the ocean just sat there , '' provid neither low tide nor high tide and leav a mean depth of three feet over the reef . the craft ground on the edg of the reef , and mani marin were kill or injur as they wade number yard to the shore , rifl over their head , in the face of machine-gun fire from the japanes . ask by a former marin about the tidal phenomenon , dr. olson spent six month research and master tidal theori and discov that the militari planner were awar that they had to contend with a `` neap '' tide . thi phenomenon occur twice a month when the moon is near it first or last quarter , becaus the counter tug of the sun caus water level to deviat less . but that day , the moon wa also almost at it farthest point from earth and exert even less pull , leav the water rel undisturb and the marin in troubl . `` i 'm not in the least blame the planner , '' dr. olson said , explain that the techniqu use in accur determin tide had n't been appli to the water at tarawa . inde , he modestli claim , by use hi comput program , `` we can calcul the tide in ani port in the world on ani day in histori . '' yet dr. olson 's greatest satisfact seem to stem from hi interdisciplinari approach to astronom sleuth . `` i have thought about van gogh , about shakespear and chaucer , '' he say , `` and that ha made my life as a scientist much richer .
