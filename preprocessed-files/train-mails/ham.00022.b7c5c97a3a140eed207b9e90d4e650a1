how mani redhat admin out there use the redhat kickstart ? if you do n't use it , how do you instal redhat on all your workstat , do you do it by hand , with the cd ? as we are look at use linux at work , i 'm look into set up the kickstart . there doe n't seem to be a lot of document around about it . doe anybodi know if it would be possibl to do the follow : get the machin to boot use dhcp and read it 's kickstart config file from teh dhcp server and in thi config file have the machin configur to use a static ip , so that when the machin is reboot it will come up with it 's new ip . also , there wa no driver on the redhat network instal flopopi for the network card in the machin i 'm instal . thi requir me to uncompress the floppi imag , loop mount it , add in the modul for the network card and compress it all up again . i 'm not go to be abl to do thi everi time we get a new machin , i wa wonder if instead of have a boot floppi , you could use a boot cdrom , but just for the purpos of have all the network card modul on the cdrom . i 'd still want it to get the packag from an nf server on the network . ani help with thi would be greatli appreci , cheer , decci . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - declan houlihan emailaddr httpaddr -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- irish linux user ' group : emailaddr httpaddr for ( un ) subscript inform . list maintain : emailaddr
