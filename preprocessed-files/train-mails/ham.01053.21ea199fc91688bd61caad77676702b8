i 've heard bush say thi ( verbatim ) glm > more than onc , and with a straight face . person , i do n't know where you got that from . here 's how i grok the whole piec . a theori ( in thi case , that fantasi wa the propag force/dr ? ) behind a given act , that from those not in the fantasi seem moral outrag , repugn or unjustifi . he list mani exampl , oldi and goodi . i do n't think the author meant to come off at the point that you seem to be conjectur -- that thi is pure an 'other ' offens . i certainli did n't read it that way , but it _did_ bother me that he did not includ some of the exampl i list , or as damien ?

sure , i 'll bite that the articl had rhetor . i 'll also bite that he wa n't fair entir with hi theori . if he meant it to be a univers ( capabl of includ even the common father with a footbal complex dream ) he should have includ our delus in all of thi . but honestli , where in the hell did you get 'cleans ourselv of 'them ' , the 'non-human ' ( or lesser-human ) object ... ?

what if al queda is in fact glm > more like our mafia or biker gang or school board truste ? well , as sinist as the schoolboard is , they did n't go kill numberk+ peopl . let put some of thi moral relativ de jour into perspect here . al'qaeda had a fantasi . thi fantasi involv a whole mess of 'other ' not in their collect fantasi . thi _is_ much like the mafia 's collect fantasi about brotherhood and organ crime , or the biker gang 's fantasi about be badass on the road or the school board 's fantasi about indoctrin your children with jesu , but it not equival . the terrorist went out , and purpos destroy thing , and kill peopl . thi is bad , i do n't care what univers you 're in . while the aspect of 'fantasi ' can be appli to all group , and that label can be equival , the perpetr of the fantasi ha differ effect and must be judg differ . otherwis , what a genocid ? just a father-son complex gone terribl awri ? glm > what if they oper by the same neural-ann maxima-minima glm > gratif mechan as you or i and everi other creatur on thi glm > planet ? they just may , that doe n't disput that their fantasi wa a deadli one . glm > what if , instead of magic and uniqu alien , they are , just like glm > our own captain and leader , realli onli in it for the money , for glm > trade rights-of-way and for power over minion who will foolishli make glm > it all happen , minion whom they can onc again dup with /virtually/ glm > /identical/ rhetor ... except we call their `` fundamentalist islam '' , glm > and they call our `` imperialist satan '' ?
